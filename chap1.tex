\chapter{Introduction}
Mercury (Hg) is a severe health hazard in the environment and for people, especially fetuses and young children\cite{gibb_mercury_2014}. The release of mercury into the atmosphere results from human activities and natural processes. Upon release, mercury moves between the air, soils, and waters until, eventually, it is removed from the system through burial in coastal and deep ocean sediments, lake sediments, and subsurface soils \cite{esdaile_mercury_2018}. Moreover, mercury can travel great distances when emitted into the atmosphere, contaminating ecosystems, fish, birds, mammals, and human food chains \cite{esdaile_mercury_2018}. Recent estimates, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:gma2018_hg-emissions_by-industry},  indicate that about 38\% of global Hg emissions come from ASGM, making it the largest source of Hg pollution to the atmosphere and hydrosphere around the world\cite{united_nations_environment_programme_technical_2019}. However, the amount of Hg released by ASGM activities and the extent to which it is transported regionally and globally is highly uncertain. This thesis examines how top-down emissions estimation techniques can help reduce the uncertainty in ASGM Hg estimates. First, we will briefly describe the Hg problem in ASGM. As a next step, we review the state of atmospheric Hg monitoring and modeling in regions where ASGM activities are prevalent. In addition, we use observed atmospheric Hg concentrations and atmospheric Hg predictions produced by the GEOS-Chem Model to come up with the first-ever top-down estimates of ASGM Hg emissions for a region in Peru. Lastly, we synthesize the findings and make recommendations for policymakers to use monitoring and modeling to better understand ASGM Hg emissions. To comply with the Minamata Convention, we will use the term "Hg emissions" throughout this thesis to refer to Hg discharges into the atmosphere and "Hg releases" to refer to Hg discharges into the ground and water. "Hg discharge" will be used when referring to both emissions and releases.

\section{Motivation}
\begin{flushleft}
More than 100 million people depend on artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) for their livelihood globally, particularly in the over 81 countries, predominantly in the global south where ASGM exists\cite{planetgold_planetgold_2021}. Additionally, ASGM is an essential source of income and an opportunity for rural development in countries where options and alternatives to ASGM for generating income to buy necessities of daily life are in short supply or nonexistent \cite{planetgold_planetgold_2021}. It is estimated that around 10 to 20 million (ASGM) miners are employed in ASGM worldwide - about a third of them are women - and they provide 90\% of the global gold mining workforce and extract about 20\% of the world's gold annually \cite{planetgold_planetgold_2021}. For example, in Peru, ASGM sustains the livelihoods of an estimated 1 million people, and between 300,000 and 500,000 miners were involved in Peru's ASGM sector as of 2014. Despite being a vital source of livelihood for the communities that practice ASGM, its activities often lead to several environmental, human, and social harms. In addition to Hg releases to the environment, ASGM externalities include deforestation, tropical diseases such as malaria, dangerous and unsafe working conditions, crime and exploitation of indigenous communities, diesel and gasoline spills, and human trafficking \cite{usaid_usaid_2020}. 
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
While most of the Hg pollution from ASGM is local, its ability to travel across borders and contaminate distant ecosystems bolsters the case for concerted global efforts to eliminate Hg pollution in all forms, including ASGM Hg pollution. The Minamata Convention (MC) is one of the unified global efforts to combat Hg pollution. It is a legally binding global treaty with 137 parties as of this writing, and its goal is to protect human health and the environment from the adverse effects of mercury. The MC's text comprises articles that address different sources of Hg pollution, including ASGM Hg emissions\cite{unep_minamata_2013}. This thesis work is inspired by the need to improve our understanding of Hg emissions and Hg's regional and global transport to ensure that policies and actions taken to reduce ASGM Hg emissions are informed by the best available science and take advantage of all resources at our disposal to create actionable scientific knowledge.

\section{Mercury Use in Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining}

\begin{flushleft} 
During ASGM, Hg is added to the gold ore to form a mercury-gold amalgam, a mixture of about equal amounts of Hg and gold\cite{united_nations_environment_programme_reducing_2012}. Heat is applied to the amalgam, which evaporates the Hg, leaving the gold behind. Gold extraction using this method is popular with the ASGM community since it is inexpensive, easy to use, and quick \cite{united_nations_environment_programme_reducing_2012}. Moreover, Hg is relatively effective at capturing gold when there are no alternatives but often captures less than 40\% \cite{united_nations_environment_programme_developing_2015}. There is usually a tremendous amount of Hg vapor in the air around amalgam burning sites, much higher than the World Health Organization(WHO) limit of 1.0 $\mu$g/m$^{3}$\cite{gibb_mercury_2014}. The Hg emissions in ASGM are harmful to miners and members of their communities.
Additionally, humans and ecosystems far away are also exposed to Hg risks because Hg travels globally through the atmosphere. As volatilized Hg subsequently settles in soil, rivers, bays, and oceans, anaerobic organisms transform it into methylmercury, and water bodies can become contaminated with methylmercury\cite{united_nations_environment_programme_technical_2019}. Methylmercury is absorbed and ingested by phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish, and predator species such as sharks and swordfish that live a long time accumulate methylmercury and can cause health damages to people who eat fish\cite{gibb_mercury_2014}.

\section{ASGM Measures in the Minamata Convention}
\begin{flushleft}
    

The MC was agreed upon at the fifth meeting of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Hg in Geneva, Switzerland, in January 2013 and formally adopted in October that year in Kumamoto, Japan. Moreover, the treaty entered into force on 16 August 2017, 90 days after the 50\textsuperscript{th} instrument of ratification was deposited, and currently has 137 parties to the convention\cite{unep_minamata_2013}. The MC's goal is to protect human health and the environment from the adverse effects of mercury, and it affirmed that global action is essential to address the Hg pollution problem. Article 7 and Annex C of the MC target ASGM. Article 7 requires countries where Hg use in ASGM is “more than insignificant” to develop a National Action Plan (NAP) that details ways to reduce and, where possible, eliminate the use of Hg and Hg compounds. Each country should include in its NAP actions to stop some of the worst practices of ASGM, which include, among other things, (i) whole ore amalgamation, (ii) open burning of amalgam, (iii) burning of amalgam in residential areas (iv), and cyanide leaching in sediment or tailings to which Hg has been added without first removing the Hg \cite{united_nations_environment_programme_technical_2019}.
Moreover, countries are required to include in their NAPs baseline estimates the quantities of Hg used in ASGM. The UNEP \textit{Guidance Document: Developing a National Action Plan to Reduce and, Where Feasible, Eliminate Mercury Use in Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining}(MC Monitoring Guidance) \cite{unep_developing_2017} states that the goal should be to produce an estimate with an accuracy of $\pm$ 30\% and, at worst, $\pm$ 50\%.  This is argued to be an obtainable level of confidence in the context of effort, time, and financial resources while being good enough to inform the NAP and allow for prioritization of actions \cite{unep_developing_2017}. A vital component of the MC is Article 22, which specifies a variety of information that must be included when conducting the effectiveness evaluation of the MC. The article states that "the Conference of the Parties shall, at its first meeting, initiate the establishment of arrangements for providing itself with comparable monitoring data on the presence and movement of Hg and Hg compounds in the environment as well as trends in levels of Hg and Hg compounds observed in biotic media and vulnerable populations." This thesis aims to demonstrate the value atmospheric modeling and monitoring would add to the process mandated by article 22 by evaluating the state of atmospheric monitoring and modeling in world regions with high ASGM incidence. Moreover, the role and the value of monitoring and modeling in the effectiveness evaluation of the MC were emphasized in the recently published MC Monitoring Guidance\cite{unep_guidance_2021}.

\section{Case Study Region}
\begin{flushleft}
The estimated amounts of ASGM Hg emissions from the different countries vary. This is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:global_asgm_emissions}, which is a map showing the GMA 2018 ASGM \hg emission estimates for 2015 for all countries worldwide that have ASGM \hg emissions and a bar chart showing countries estimated to emit more than 10 tons/year of Hg from ASGM \cite{united_nations_environment_programme_technical_2019}. Moreover, the GMA 2018 reported that ASGM Hg emissions in Latin America were the highest \cite{united_nations_environment_programme_technical_2019}. Figure \ref{fig:global_asgm_emissions} shows that Latin America has the highest concentration of countries have estimated ASGM Hg emissions above 40 tons/year \cite{united_nations_environment_programme_technical_2019}. Furthermore, Latin America has the highest average ratio of mercury losses to gold production at 4.63, according to Yoshimura et al.'s\cite{yoshimura_estimation_2021} estimate. This means that for every gram of gold produced, 4.63 grams of Hg are "lost" (i.e. discharged to the environment). Africa and Asia have the lowest at 1.96 and 1.23, respectively.  However, atmospheric Hg data from Latin America are rare; hence Hg dynamics in the region are not well understood.

Peru is the source of the largest ASGM Hg emissions in Latin America and the second largest source globally, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:global_asgm_emissions}. In Peru, the Madre de Dios region provides an ideal place for Hg research because the process of ASGM in this region involves mainly an amalgamation of the whole ore, which is the more Hg-intensive of all ASGM processes and is recommended as a "worst practice" to be eliminated by the Minamata Convention\cite{unep_global_2017}. The process of whole ore amalgamation involves pouring liquid Hg into old oil drums and mixing it with gold-flecked sediment. Miners spend hours immersed in toxic mud with their pants rolled up to their knees in traditional winemaking style. The ratio of liquid Hg to gold amalgam is around 2:1\cite{fraser_peruvian_2009,swenson_gold_2011,veiga_origin_2006}. As soon as the mercury amalgam is formed, miners burn it off to sell the gold. Hg is often burned off by "gold-changers" in the open air with blowtorches in market areas also occupied by other local small businesses. In addition to posing environmental risks, this mercury can also harm women and children\cite{diringer_river_2015}. 
\end{flushleft}

\begin{flushleft}
The Madre de Dios region is estimated to be the source of the largest quantities of Hg to the environment and the atmosphere\cite{agc_reporte_2017}. Madre de Dios, shown by the red outline in Figure \ref{fig:PeruCS}, is a rainforest region between Bolivia and Brazil and covers roughly 85,000 square kilometers. The region's name is derived from the name of a major river that runs through it, and smaller streams and rivers cross through it to provide transportation and fishing for indigenous communities. Furthermore, these waterways are the main sites of ASGM and, subsequently, Hg contamination \cite{ashe_elevated_2012,agc_reporte_2017}. The other regions around Madre de Dios that are sources of large quantities of Hg are outlined in Figure \ref{fig:PeruCS}. The department of Puno is highlighted in purple, Arequipa is shown by the blue outline, Ayachucho with the green outline, Apurimac with the orange outline, and Cusco with the maroon outline.

Environmental and human health effects of ASGM Hg pollution have been extensively studied in Madre de Dios. This thesis project seeks to complement previous studies and distinguish itself  by investigating the extent to which the GEOS-Chem model can leverage existing measurements of Hg in the atmosphere to produce top-down estimates of ASGM Hg emissions from Madre de Dios and surrounding departments with reported ASGM activities.

 \section{Thesis Questions}
 Several studies have identified atmospheric mercury monitoring as a primary and appropriate method to assess the effectiveness of the MC \cite{sprovieri_atmospheric_2016,evers_evaluating_2016,gustin_measuring_2015,united_nations_environment_programme_technical_2019}. Additionally, according to the MC's Monitoring Guidance one of the primary objectives of monitoring Hg in the atmosphere is to provide data for the development and improvement of transport and chemistry models\cite{unep_guidance_2021}. However, few studies have shown how monitoring data and atmospheric models can inform policy on ASGM Hg emissions. Therefore, we seek to answer the following questions based on the assumption that using chemical transport models (CTMs), such as GEOS-Chem, we can synthesize data from national and global Hg inventories and atmospheric monitoring networks for tracking progress and assessing MC's effectiveness:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item To what extent can regional atmospheric modeling and monitoring help reconcile the differences in the current global estimates of emissions and national emissions?
  \item How can regional monitoring networks improve the utility of models for evaluating the effectiveness of MCs?
  \item Which atmospheric modeling and monitoring should be prioritized by governments and policy makers to obtain actionable information about Hg reductions?
\end{enumerate}
\end{flushleft}

 
\section{Organization}
 
\begin{flushleft}
  This introductory chapter has provided a general background on ASGM concerning Hg emissions and the extent of global efforts to protect people and the environment from the adverse effects of Hg pollution. Chapter 2 compares the temporal and spatial characteristics of observed and modeled atmospheric Hg concentrations. It addresses aspects  of the first thesis question by evaluating GEOS-Chem modeled atmospheric Hg concentrations across Latin America with observed Hg concentrations at various regional sites. In chapter 3, a method is presented for estimating ASGM Hg emissions. Using atmospheric modeling and monitoring, it is demonstrated how different ASGM Hg emissions inventories can be reconciled and how monitoring networks can enhance models' utility. Finally, chapter 4 presents policy recommendations and conclusions to address the third research question.
