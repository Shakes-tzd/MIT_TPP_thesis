	abstract = {Mercury is a global pollutant that poses threats to ecosystems and to human health. Due to its global transport, mercury contamination is found in regions of the Earth that are remote from major emissions areas, including the Polar regions. Global anthropogenic emission inventories identify important sectors and industries responsible for emissions at a national level; however, to be useful for air transport modelling, more precise information on the locations of emission is required. This paper describes the methodology applied, and the results of work that was conducted to geospatially distribute anthropogenic mercury emissions as part of the global anthropogenic mercury emissions inventory for 2015 prepared by AMAP/UNEP for the Global Mercury Assessment (GMA) 2018 (UN Environment, 2019). This work includes the identification and use of emission point sources as well as distributing diffuse emissions for 21 emission (industry) sectors. The basic approach involves assigning emission estimates to geo-located point sources, using reported emissions information where available, and otherwise assigning a modelled emission to the point. Emissions which cannot be assigned to point sources are distributed using sector-specific proxies. Mercury speciation highly depends on industry processes and air pollution control technology. Different Hg speciation ratios are therefore applied per sector and country technology level. The resulting global emission datasets include total mercury (HgT), gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0), divalent mercury (Hg2+) and particulate mercury (HgP) in kg per year per raster cell (kg/a). The spatial resolution is flexible and the vertical resolution of the data is based on a set of predefined height classes. The resolution of the GMA2018 emission data is 0.25° × 0.25° with three (physical emission) height classes (0–50, 50–150 and {\textgreater} 150m). A comparison with the EMEP European mercury emission was made based on spatial correlation between the two datasets. Suggested improvements for future work include the further development of proxy data and the implementation of a more structured reporting of emissions by countries.},

The PDFs are constrained by observations of tracer concentrations and account for uncertainty in meteorology, transport, diffusion, and emissions. Meteorological uncertainty is calculated using an ensemble of simulations of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model that samples five categories of model inputs (initialization time, boundary layer physics, land surface model, nudging options, and reanalysis data). The WRF output is used to drive tens of thousands of FLEXPART dispersion simulations that sample a uniform distribution of six emissions inputs. Machine-learning algorithms are trained on the ensemble data and used to quantify the sources of ensemble variability and to infer, via inverse modeling, the values of the 11 model inputs most consistent with tracer measurements. We find a substantial ensemble spread in tracer concentrations (factors of 10 to 10$^{\textrm{3}}$), most of which is due to changing emissions inputs (about 80 \%), though the cumulative effects of meteorological variations are not negligible. The performance of the inverse method is verified using synthetic observations generated from arbitrarily selected simulations. When applied to measurements from a controlled tracer release experiment, the inverse method satisfactorily determines the location, start time, duration and amount. In a 2 km × 2 km area of possible locations, the actual location is determined to within 200 m. The start time is determined to within 5 min out of 2 h, and the duration to within 50 min out of 4 h. Over a range of release amounts of 10 to 1000 kg, the estimated amount exceeds the actual amount of 146 kg by only 32 kg. The inversion also estimates probabilities of different WRF configurations. To best match the tracer observations, the highest-probability cases in WRF are associated with using a late initialization time and specific reanalysis data products.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The Global Mercury Observation System (GMOS) project was funded by the European Commission ({\textless}a href="http://www.gmos.eu" target="\_blank"{\textgreater}http://www.gmos.eu{\textless}/a{\textgreater}) and started in November 2010 with the overall goal to develop a coordinated global observing system to monitor Hg on a global scale, including a large network of ground-based monitoring stations, ad hoc periodic oceanographic cruises and measurement flights in the lower and upper troposphere as well as in the lower stratosphere. To date, more than 40 ground-based monitoring sites constitute the global network covering many regions where little to no observational data were available before GMOS. This work presents atmospheric Hg concentrations recorded worldwide in the framework of the GMOS project (2010–2015), analyzing Hg measurement results in terms of temporal trends, seasonality and comparability within the network. Major findings highlighted in this paper include a clear gradient of Hg concentrations between the Northern and Southern hemispheres, confirming that the gradient observed is mostly driven by local and regional sources, which can be anthropogenic, natural or a combination of both.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Examples include nonnegativity (e.g., emissions of some urban air pollutants) or upward limits implied by reaction or solubility constants. However, probabilistic inverse modeling approaches based on Gaussian assumptions cannot incorporate such bounds and thus often produce unrealistic results. The atmospheric literature lacks consensus on the best means to overcome this problem, and existing atmospheric studies rely on a limited number of the possible methods with little examination of the relative merits of each. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} This paper investigates the applicability of several approaches to bounded inverse problems. A common method of data transformations is found to unrealistically skew estimates for the examined example application. The method of Lagrange multipliers and two Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods yield more realistic and accurate results. In general, the examined MCMC approaches produce the most realistic result but can require substantial computational time. Lagrange multipliers offer an appealing option for large, computationally intensive problems when exact uncertainty bounds are less central to the analysis. A synthetic data inversion of US anthropogenic methane emissions illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

After examining the long historical trajectory that has relegated most ASM activities in sub-Saharan Africa to the informal economy, three of the sector’s more obvious economic impacts are reviewed: its contribution to regional mineral outputs; how operations create employment opportunities for millions of people directly, and millions more in the downstream and upstream industries they spawn; and the links the sector has with subsistence agriculture, dynamics which have important implications for food security and gender equality. These contributions alone are sufficient justification for featuring ASM more prominently in the plans, policies and programs being launched in sub-Saharan Africa to help host governments meet their commitments to the SDGs.},

The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimated in 1999 that ASM employed 13 million people iworldwide, making an important contribution to poverty alleviation in rural areas. Despite this positive contribution, the sector often brings a series of environmental and social problems to the areas in which it occurs. The case studies developed for this report ii illustrate that ASGM can transform itself quickly when the correct regulatory, economic, and other conditions are put in place. The sector has a demonstrated ability to seize opportunities, as shown in the case of Peru, and more recently Mongolia, where legal frameworks were promulgated resulting in a “rush” to obtain new mining licenses, iii or in the case of ethical initiatives in which the uptake by the producer organizations of the fair trade certification scheme has been very high. iv This report concludes that high levels of ASGM informality are rooted mainly in legal, political, and economic marginalization vor where legal frameworks and other public policy plans and programs exist but are not designed to address the unique challenges of the sector. It is clear from previous experience, especially UNIDO’s Global Mercury Project, vi that international cooperation and national support for the sector is desirable and welcome. To be effective, the support must be long-term and must deal with the root causes of problems (such as inadequate public policy and a lack of environmental, technical, and entrepreneurial knowledge) while also addressing health, safety, and environmental concerns. In doing so, it will be possible to create the conditions for ASGM to become a profitable and sustainable mining sector.},

	abstract = {Artisanal and small-scale gold mining has been practiced since ancient times in Peru, currently it is developed throughout the national territory, although concentrated in certain regions. Most of this activity is carried out informally and even illegally, characterized by the use of a large amount of labor and low technology; In recent years, situations such as the high price of gold have caused a great growth in this activity. During 2017, as part of the activities of the project of the National Action Plan for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining, led by the Artisanal Gold Council, UNIDO and with financing from the World Environment Fund, the reference estimates of the use and mercury consumption in ASM. For the development of the estimates, the methodology by Artisanal Gold Council (2015) was used in the Practical Guide for the development of Reference Estimates of the use of Mercury in artisanal and small-scale gold, 2015, accepted by the United Nations. The work focused on the regions of Madre de Dios, Puno, Arequipa and Ayacucho, since they concentrate approximately 94\% of ASM gold production. Among the main results found, it stands out that: The estimated artisanal and small-scale gold production in Peru is 148.77 tons per year, of which 87.97\% is processed by amalgamation with mercury, the remaining 12\% corresponds mainly to cyanidation. The use of mercury for artisanal and smallscale gold processing in Peru causes an annual loss of 362.47 tons of mercury. The region of Madre de Dios, where alluvial mining is practiced, concentrates the largest production of gold in ASM and the largest emissions and releases of mercury (181 tons of mercury), which represents 50\% of the national total, followed by Arequipa and Puno with 21.9 and 17.8\% respectively. Mercury losses occur during the preparation of the amalgam and its burning and are influenced by the type of deposit, the characteristics of the raw ore, the exploitation and benefit methods, and the experience of the operators. In all cases, it has been found that the use of mercury recovery systems such as retorts is very limited and does not have a significant impact on production. The great diversity of mining sites and processing methods means that there is great variability in the ratio of mercury loss to the amount of gold produced, for example the lowest value (2.1:1) was found in the Huepethue area in Madre de Dios with the use of mechanized methods (shute and front loader), while the highest loss ratio was found in Cháparra and Arequipa with the use of quimbaletes (8.7:1). The sector called La Pampa in Madre de Dios is the main source of emissions and releases with 40\% of the national total (145 tons), followed by Rinconada in Puno with 13\% (46 tons) and Secocha in Arequipa with 8\%. (27.8 tons).},

This article contributes to this discussion, drawing on fresh evidence from Ghana, the location of one of the largest and most  dynamic ASM economies in sub-Saharan Africa.  Here, it is explained, there is a sizable gap between what the government believes ASM is, and what it actually is.  This misdiagnosis has spawned a regulatory apparatus that has proved to be a formidable barrier for ASM operators who are attempting to transition to the formal economy.  But rather than highlighting this oversight, the media, government officials and donors have focused mainly on the negative aspects of the sector that policy has ‘created’, including its environmental footprint, poor health and safety record, and numerous social ‘ills’.  The attention paid to these ‘expressions’ of ASM’s  informality and its unsustainable growth trajectory could potentially derail efforts to formalize a sector which, if adequately supported, could catalyze much-needed economic development in one of the world’s poorest regions.},

To understand related environmental impacts, specifically toxicity and climate change, this study uses Life Cycle Assessment methodology. Four predominant extraction systems were selected and modelled and three scenarios that reflect currently available gold recovery systems were modelled: amalgamation, amalgamation with mercury recovery through retort system and gravimetric tables. The USEtox and IPCC life cycle impact assessment methods were used to assess the environmental impacts in term of human toxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity and climate change. Results show that for all systems, human toxicity values are governed by mercury emissions in gold recovery activities (ca. 80\%). However, the use of retort significantly lowers these impacts (ca. 90\%). Machines and diesel use for ore extraction and freighting activities drive freshwater ecotoxicity. Moreover, deforestation has a major contribution on the environmental impacts related to climate change. However, these impacts are dependent on the type of extraction system. Although human toxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity and climate change are frequently studied separately, a direct relationship between them has been identified in this system. Finally, beyond the environmental burdens related to alluvial gold mining, there are impacts affecting the social, cultural, and economic dimensions that will need to be analyzed to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the system.},

	abstract = {Selenium (Se) is an essential dietary element for humans and animals, and the atmosphere is an important source of Se to soils. However, estimates of global atmospheric Se fluxes are highly uncertain. To constrain these uncertainties, we use a global model of atmospheric Se cycling and a database of more than 600 sites where Se in aerosol has been measured. Applying Bayesian inference techniques, we determine the probability distributions of global Se emissions from the four major sources: anthropogenic activities, volcanoes, marine biosphere, and terrestrial biosphere. Between 29 and 36 Gg of Se are emitted to the atmosphere every year, doubling previous estimates of emissions. Using emission parameters optimized by aerosol network measurements, our model shows good agreement with the aerosol Se observations (R2 = 0.66), as well as with independent aerosol (0.59) and wet deposition measurements (0.57). Both model and measurements show a decline in Se over North America in the last two decades because of changes in technology and energy policy. Our results highlight the role of the ocean as a net atmospheric Se sink, with around 7 Gg yr–1 of Se transferred from land through the atmosphere. The constrained Se emissions represent a substantial step forward in understanding the global Se cycle.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the formalization of artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) activities has become a key strategy for governments to better govern and regulate the sector. While scholars have focused on examining the viability of formalization itself, little is known about the outcomes once ASGM operations become formal, or whether formalization efforts are sustainable. Peru has made great strides on simplifying the formalization process and has formalized over 9600 artisanal miners. Drawing on a case study from one of these formalized operations, this research examines postformalization outcomes. Findings from interviews with government officials and members of the ASGM community in one of the most important ASGM regions of Peru, Puno, demonstrate that formalization has yielded mixed results. Formal ASGM operations have improved health and safety practices and labor conditions, and miners believe their environmental awareness has increased. Despite these changes, miners who have become formalized feel even more pursued and scrutinized than they did when they operated informally, and they continue to face challenges obtaining technical support and accessing capital. We argue that although some progress has been made in formalization efforts, the problems and weaknesses within the approach may inadvertently push miners back into informality.We conclude that in order for formalization to be more fruitful for governments and miners, governments working on formalizing ASGM activities would greatly benefit from the creation of a solid postformalization strategy focused on educating and supporting formal ASGM operations.},

	abstract = {Mercury (Hg) is a naturally occurring element in the Earth's crust. It can be harmful to human health when released in large quantities and/or converted to the neurotoxicant methyl mercury in aquatic ecosystems. This study analyzes global and regional trends in anthropogenic Hg releases to the atmosphere between 2010 and 2015, as well as the associated trends in modeled and measured Hg concentrations at sites around the world. In general, we find that global Hg emissions and concentrations have grown slightly in this period, as declines from the phase-out of commercial Hg use in the developed world have been more than matched by increases in Hg-related activities in the industrializing countries of the world. We estimate that global Hg emissions between 2010 and 2015 have grown at a rate of 1.8\%/yr, from 2188 Mg (+44\%/-20\%, 80\% C.I.) in 2010 to 2390 Mg (+42\%/-19\%, 80\% C.I.) in 2015. Regionally, emissions declined over this period in the U.S. (−10\%), OECD Europe (−5.8\%), and Canada (−3.2\%), while they increased in Central America (+5.4\%), South Asia (+4.6\%), and Eastern Africa (+4.0\%). East Asia remained the largest emitting region at 1012 Mg in 2015, though growth there has slowed significantly in recent years. The production of Hg (+7.9\%), caustic soda (+6.3\%), and cement (+6.3\%) showed the highest increases by source type, though artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) was the single largest source of emissions in 2015 (775 Mg). The commercial use of Hg in dental applications (−5.6\%) and electrical equipment (−5.2\%) continued to decline. These emission trends show a continuation of the regional and sectoral shifts that began in the 1970s, but with a resulting reversal in global trends, because the benefits from Hg phase-out in North America and Europe have been largely realized and industrial growth in developing countries has begun to dominate. The emission trends are in agreement with trends in modeled and measured concentrations, which show small declines in surface air total gaseous Hg concentrations in eastern North America and Western Europe between 2010 and 2015, but slight increases for much of the rest of the world, driven by the continued increases in emissions from Asia and from ASGM. Our results suggest that reductions of Hg in the North Atlantic region have been largely successful, and focus now needs to shift to Asia and to the continued practice of ASGM worldwide.},

The purpose was to evaluate the accuracy of the PAS vis-à-vis the industry standard active instruments and to determine a sampling rate (SR; the volume of air stripped of gaseous Hg per unit of time) that is applicable across a wide range of conditions. The sites spanned a wide range of latitudes, altitudes, meteorological conditions, and gaseous Hg concentrations.

At the mean gaseous Hg concentration across the study sites of 1.54\&thinsp;ng\&thinsp;m{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−3}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, this represents an ability to resolve concentrations to within 0.13\&thinsp;ng\&thinsp;m{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−3}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}.

This value (8.{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{7}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;5.{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{7}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;\%) represents a conservative assessment of the overall uncertainty of the PAS due to inherent uncertainties of the Tekran instruments. Going forward, the recalibrated SR adjusted for temperature and wind speed should be used, especially if conditions are highly variable or deviate considerably from the average of the deployments in this study (9.8{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{9}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C, 3.4{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;m\&thinsp;s{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}$){\textless}/span{\textgreater}. Overall, the study demonstrates that the sampler is capable of recording background gaseous Hg concentrations across a wide range of environmental conditions with accuracy similar to that of industry standard active sampling instruments. Results at sites with active speciation units were inconclusive on whether the PASs take up total gaseous Hg or solely gaseous elemental Hg primarily because gaseous oxidized Hg concentrations were in a similar range as the uncertainty of the PAS.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This paper helps balance the literature via comparative analysis of the contributions of two voluntary sustainability certification programs for artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) run by Fairtrade International and the Alliance for Responsible Mining. Assessment of four indicators of contribution strength (SDG alignment, rule stringency, uptake patterns, indirect effects) suggest weak to moderate contributions to date. First, only the weakest versions of standards are being adopted and only by miners above the poverty line prior to certification. Second, adoption levels are low, and rates of decertification quite high. Third, indirect effects on consumers and public actors are equally weak. Yet programs do align well with the SDGs. To improve, programs should consider uniting, becoming more “producer friendly,” and decide which role within SDG and ASGM governance regimes they are best suited to play (which may be none at all). Findings contribute to debates on the merits of increasing global governance fragmentation and the role transnationalism in global problem-solving. The understudied ASGM case provides lessons about the diffusion of certification to new sectors, with the aim of guiding global resources towards their most efficient and effective ends.},

The models were compared between each other and with available measurements from 11 monitoring stations of the EMEP measurement network. Because only a very limited number of long-term measurement records of Hg were available, significant attention was given to the intercomparison of modelling results. Monthly and annually averaged values of Hg concentrations and depositions as well as items of the Hg deposition budgets for individual European countries were compared. The models demonstrated good agreement (within +/-20\%) between annual modelled and observed values of gaseous elemental Hg. Modelled values of Hg wet deposition in Western and Central Europe agreed with the observations within +/-45\%. The probability to predict wet depositions within a factor of 2 with regard to measurements was 50-70\% for all the models. The scattering of modelling results for dry depositions of Hg was more significant (up to +/-50\% at the annual scale and even higher for monthly data). Contribution of dry deposition to the total Hg deposition was estimated at 20-30\% with elevated dry deposition fluxes during summer time. The participating models agree in their predictions of transboundary pollution for individual countries within +/-60\% at the monthly scale and within +/-30\% at the annual scale. For the cases investigated, all the models predict that the major part of national anthropogenic Hg emissions is transported outside the country territory.},

The aim of the current paper was to describe specific activities undertaken and how they were organized, and the outputs and outcomes of our activity. In brief, three disciplinary workgroups (Natural Sciences, Human Health, Social Sciences and Economics) were formed, with 26 researchers from a range of Ghanaian institutions plus international experts. The workgroups conducted activities in order to address the following question: What are the causes, consequences and correctives of small-scale gold mining in Ghana? More specifically: What alternatives are available in resource-limited settings in Ghana that allow for gold-mining to occur in a manner that maintains ecological health and human health without hindering near- and long-term economic prosperity? Several response options were identified and evaluated, and are currently being disseminated to various stakeholders within Ghana and internationally.},

	abstract = {Many reports have been written about the issues surrounding small scale miners’ challenges in Namibia; yet little has been done to address these challenges. There has been a fragmented approach to address these challenges. Various government arms and donororganizationshave utilizedpiece meal methods in the past in trying to make improvements on the productivities across the sector, but with no meaningful success.This has led to the design and implementation of inappropriate technologies and support services for the sector. The structures of many of the semi-precious stones mining businesses are informal, with very little royalties received by the government. Miners often work informally or illegally andthey fear government interference and they distrustoutsiders, resulting in them withholding production information. The presence of small scale miners is quite often associated with major challenges, including poor safety and environmental management standards, the spread of communicable diseases and poorworking conditions. The majority of the miners employ uncontrolled extraction techniques which damage the crystals and mineral specimens, resulting in intermediate and final products of low quality along with high wastage at the extraction stage. The vision of the Namibian government is to expand the range and value of semi-precious stones and jewelryproducts processed within Namibia, while curbing illicit flows of raw stones. This will simultaneously secure maximum benefit for the country. This study investigated the interventions aimed at making the small scale mining sector in Namibia sustainable. A baseline study was conducted to analyzethe current situation and characterizethe industry, including a SWOT analysis. Information was collected through questionnaires, interviews, consultative meetings, field visits and workshops in order to profile the sector. The baseline study results were used in developing interventions for improving artisanal and small scale mining operations. The main challenges for the Namibian semi-precious sector were identified as: factual information about raw material resources and its beneficiation are insufficient or not available, lack of skills, lack of education and access to finances, rudimentary exploration and mining practices, trading and logistics that are not functioning effectively and inadequate sector governance. One key finding of this study was that Namibia is not benefiting through value addition due partly to illicit flows of the uncut stones and to the fact that lapidary is not much pronounced to a greater extent. The following strategic interventions were identified as key in ensuring the sustainability of the small mining sector in Namibia:conducting geological assessment to identify new deposits and quantify the existing ones, improving exploration and mining practices, investing in education and training, creating an enabling environment and improving the sector governance and strengthening the sector organizationand supporting the infrastructure.},

In our study, we applied a top-down approach to quantify mercury emissions on the basis of atmospheric mercury measurements conducted at the remote high altitude monitoring station Jungfraujoch, Switzerland. We established the source-receptor relationships and by the means of atmospheric inversion we were able to quantify spatially resolved European emissions of 89 ± 14 t/a for elemental mercury. Our European emission estimate is 17\% higher than the bottom-up emission inventory, which is within stated uncertainties. However, some regions with unexpectedly high emissions were identified. Stationary combustion, in particular in coal-fired power plants, is found to be the main responsible sector for increased emission estimates. Our top-down approach, based on measurements, provides an independent constraint on mercury emissions, helps to improve and refine reported emission inventories, and can serve for continued assessment of future changes in emissions independent from bottom-up inventories.},

Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining (ASGM) has been identified as the most important anthropogenic source of Hg at a global scale and an important route of human exposure to Hg. In this context, this study assessed total Hg (THg) in blood, urine and hair, and methylmercury (MeHg) in human hair samples from 238 participants with occupational exposure to Hg in the most relevant ASGM communities of Colombia. Mercury concentrations in different biological matrices were related to several variables of interest such as age, gender, body mass index, fish consumption, exposure time, and specific occupational activities, such as amalgamation and amalgam burning. The median values of THg in blood (3.70 µg/L), urine (4.00 µg/L) and hair (1.37 mg/kg), and hair MeHg (1.47 mg/kg) for all participants were below permissible concentrations set by WHO. However, about 40\% of the miners showed Hg concentrations in blood, urine and/or hair above the WHO thresholds. In all the biological matrices studied, miners burning amalgams showed significantly higher concentrations than miners who did not burn amalgams, with values 7-, 7-, and 8-fold higher in blood, urine and hair, respectively. A multiple linear regression model revealed that burning amalgam and fish consumption were significant predictors of Hg exposure in miners. Miners from Guainía had the highest concentrations in urine and hair, most likely due to the high manipulation and burning of amalgam, and a high fish consumption. In contrast, miners from Caldas showed the lowest Hg concentrations in all the biomarkers because they do not manipulate or burn amalgam, as well as reporting the lowest fish consumption. Our study also highlighted that gold miners exposure to Hg depends on their work practices. Therefore, the implementation of a health education programme on gold mining strategies is required, especially in Guaina, Vaupés, Córdoba, and Antioquia departments.},

	abstract = {Background: Mercury (Hg) is used in gold mining to extract gold from ore by forming “amalgam”—a mixture composed of approximately equal parts mercury and gold. Approximately 15 million people, including approximately 3 million women and children, participate in artisanal small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in developing countries. Thirty-seven percent of global air emissions of Hg are produced by ASGM. The recently adopted Minamata Convention calls for nations to gather health data, train health-care workers, and raise awareness in regard to ASGM activity., Objective: The purpose of our review was to evaluate the current literature regarding the health effects of Hg among those working and/or living in or near ASGM communities., Methods: We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar for studies relating to health effects and biomarkers of Hg exposure in ASGM communities. Articles published from 1990 through December 2012 were evaluated for relevance., Discussion: Studies reporting health assessments, kidney dysfunction, neurological disorders and symptoms, and immunotoxicity/autoimmune dysfunction in individuals living in or near an ASGM community were identified. More than 60 studies that measured biomarkers of Hg exposure in individuals living in or near ASGM communities were also identified. These studies, conducted in 19 different countries in South America, Asia, and Africa, demonstrated that hair and urine concentrations are well above World Health Organization health guidance values in ASGM communities., Conclusions: ASGM workers and their families are exposed to Hg vapor, and workers, workers’ families, and residents of nearby and downstream communities are consuming fish heavily contaminated with methylmercury., Citation: Gibb H, O’Leary KG. 2014.

	abstract = {Ratification of the Minamata Convention on Mercury has led to the establishment of Peruvian regulations limiting mercury concentrations in air to 2000 ng/m3over a 24-hr measurement period. As a result, three communities in Madre de Dios, Peru were mapped during October 2017 to determine Hg0 vapor concentrations in the air. The town of Tres Islas exhibited Hg0 concentrations less than 200 ng/m3: the minimum risk level defined by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. These low concentrations were reflective of a town in the region with limited exposure to artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM). However, the ASGM communities of Laberinto and Delta One exhibited concentrations of Hg0 vapor that exceeded 2,000,000 ng/m3 surrounding active gold shops, where amalgams and processed amalgams were heated with open flames. Laberinto was reevaluated in May 2018 during which time Hg0 levels on the sidewalks in front of gold shops again exceeded 2,000,000 ng/m3. Within the scope of this paper a rapid mapping technique allows for the detection of sources of Hg0 pollution and identifies neighborhoods that require intervention to decrease Hg0 emissions. In addition, this work highlights the difficulties of measuring total gaseous mercury in ASGM communities with gold shops according to the Peruvian law.},

	abstract = {We review recent progress in our understanding of the global cycling of mercury (Hg), including best estimates of Hg concentrations and pool sizes in major environmental compartments and exchange processes within and between these reservoirs. Recent advances include the availability of new global datasets covering areas of the world where environmental Hg data were previously lacking; integration of these data into global and regional models is continually improving estimates of global Hg cycling. New analytical techniques, such as Hg stable isotope characterization, provide novel constraints of sources and transformation processes. The major global Hg reservoirs that are, and continue to be, affected by anthropogenic activities include the atmosphere (4.4–5.3 Gt), terrestrial environments (particularly soils: 250–1000 Gg), and aquatic ecosystems (e.g., oceans: 270–450 Gg). Declines in anthropogenic Hg emissions between 1990 and 2010 have led to declines in atmospheric Hg0 concentrations and HgII wet deposition in Europe and the US (− 1.5 to − 2.2\% per year). Smaller atmospheric Hg0 declines (− 0.2\% per year) have been reported in high northern latitudes, but not in the southern hemisphere, while increasing atmospheric Hg loads are still reported in East Asia. New observations and updated models now suggest high concentrations of oxidized HgII in the tropical and subtropical free troposphere where deep convection can scavenge these HgII reservoirs. As a result, up to 50\% of total global wet HgII deposition has been predicted to occur to tropical oceans. Ocean Hg0 evasion is a large source of present-day atmospheric Hg (approximately 2900 Mg/year; range 1900–4200 Mg/year). Enhanced seawater Hg0 levels suggest enhanced Hg0 ocean evasion in the intertropical convergence zone, which may be linked to high HgII deposition. Estimates of gaseous Hg0 emissions to the atmosphere over land, long considered a critical Hg source, have been revised downward, and most terrestrial environments now are considered net sinks of atmospheric Hg due to substantial Hg uptake by plants. Litterfall deposition by plants is now estimated at 1020–1230 Mg/year globally. Stable isotope analysis and direct flux measurements provide evidence that in many ecosystems Hg0 deposition via plant inputs dominates, accounting for 57–94\% of Hg in soils. Of global aquatic Hg releases, around 50\% are estimated to occur in China and India, where Hg drains into the West Pacific and North Indian Oceans. A first inventory of global freshwater Hg suggests that inland freshwater Hg releases may be dominated by artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM; approximately 880 Mg/year), industrial and wastewater releases (220 Mg/year), and terrestrial mobilization (170–300 Mg/year). For pelagic ocean regions, the dominant source of Hg is atmospheric deposition; an exception is the Arctic Ocean, where riverine and coastal erosion is likely the dominant source. Ocean water Hg concentrations in the North Atlantic appear to have declined during the last several decades but have increased since the mid-1980s in the Pacific due to enhanced atmospheric deposition from the Asian continent. Finally, we provide examples of ongoing and anticipated changes in Hg cycling due to emission, climate, and land use changes. It is anticipated that future emissions changes will be strongly dependent on ASGM, as well as energy use scenarios and technology requirements implemented under the Minamata Convention. We predict that land use and climate change impacts on Hg cycling will be large and inherently linked to changes in ecosystem function and global atmospheric and ocean circulations. Our ability to predict multiple and simultaneous changes in future Hg global cycling and human exposure is rapidly developing but requires further enhancement.},

Ghana is currently confronted with pollution of its main water bodies, which has reduced the supply of good quality water to the populace. To address these problems, several attempts - policy formulation, formalisation and introduction of technical assistance - have been undertaken by the government of Ghana and other international bodies such as United Nations Industrial Development Organisation-UNIDO. Despite these attempts, majority of artisanal small-scale miners are not registered and even some registered miners together with unregistered miners indulge in unacceptable mining practices. Premised on these, the study sought to undertake a thorough review of the challenges associated with the management of ASM in Ghana and provide a framework for the effective management of the sector. Consequently, a three-pronged approach (problem analysis, planning and implementation and enforcement) with a cross-cutting focus on monitoring and evaluation is recommended.},

This leads us to review advances in the study of ASGM, linked to debates on extractivism, resource materialities, and informality. We use the notion of gold lifeways to capture how the matter of mining shapes different worlds of extraction. We argue that consideration of the potential for transformations to sustainability needs to be grounded within the realities of ASGM. This necessitates giving value to miners’ knowledge(s), perspectives and interests, while recognising the plurality of mining futures. Nevertheless, we conclude that between the immediacy of precarious work and the structural barriers to change in ASGM, the challenges for transformation cannot be underestimated.},

We assessed two competing scenarios about the impacts of 16th – late 19th century New World silver (Ag) mining, which may be the largest human source of atmospheric Hg in history. Consideration of Ag ore geochemistry, historical documents on Hg use, and comparison of the scenarios against atmospheric Hg patterns in environmental archives, strongly support a “low mining emission” scenario. Building upon this scenario and other published work, the revised global budget estimates human activities including recycled legacy emissions have increased current atmospheric Hg concentrations by about 450\% above natural levels (prevailing before 1450 AD). Current anthropogenic emissions to air are 2.5 ± 0.5 kt/y. The increase in atmospheric Hg concentrations has driven a ∼ 300\% average increase in deposition, and a 230\% increase in surface marine waters. Deeper marine waters show increases of only 12–25\%. The overall increase in Hg in surface organic soils (∼15\%) is small due to the large mass of natural Hg already present from rock weathering, but this figure varies regionally. Specific research recommendations are made to reduce uncertainties, particularly through improved understanding of fundamental processes of the Hg cycle, and continued improvements in emissions inventories from large natural and anthropogenic sources.},

	abstract = {Abstract We compare atmospheric temperature changes in satellite data and in model ensembles performed under phases 5 and 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 and CMIP6). In the lower stratosphere, multidecadal stratospheric cooling during the period of strong ozone depletion is smaller in newer CMIP6 simulations than in CMIP5 or satellite data. In the troposphere, however, despite forcing and climate sensitivity differences between the two CMIP ensembles, their ensemble-average global warming over 1979–2019 is very similar. We also examine four properties of tropical behavior governed by basic physical processes. The first three are ratios between trends in water vapor (WV) and trends in sea surface temperature (SST), lower-tropospheric temperature (TLT), and mid- to upper-tropospheric temperature (TMT). The fourth property is the ratio between TMT and SST trends. All four ratios are tightly constrained in CMIP simulations but diverge markedly in observations. Model trend ratios between WV and temperature are closest to observed ratios when the latter are calculated with datasets exhibiting larger tropical warming of the ocean surface and troposphere. For the TMT/SST ratio, model–data consistency depends on the combination of observations used to estimate TMT and SST trends. If model expectations of these four covariance relationships are realistic, our findings reflect either a systematic low bias in satellite tropospheric temperature trends or an overestimate of the observed atmospheric moistening signal. It is currently difficult to determine which interpretation is more credible. Nevertheless, our analysis reveals anomalous covariance behavior in several observational datasets and illustrates the diagnostic power of simultaneously considering multiple complementary variables.},

	abstract = {Mercury is one of the most toxic metals and has global importance due to the biomagnification and bioaccumulation of organomercury via the aquatic food web. The physical and chemical transformations of various mercury species in the atmosphere strongly influence their composition, phase, transport characteristics and deposition rate to the ground. Modeling efforts to evaluate the mercury cycling in the environment require an accurate understanding of atmospheric mercury chemistry. We focus this article on recent studies (since 2015) on improving our understanding of the atmospheric chemistry of mercury. We discuss recent advances in (i) determining the dominant atmospheric oxidant of elemental mercury (Hg0); (ii) understanding the oxidation reactions of Hg0 by halogen atoms and by nitrate radical (NO3); (iii) the aqueous reduction of oxidized mercury compounds (HgII); and (iv) the heterogeneous reactions of Hg on atmospherically-relevant surfaces. The need for future research to improve understanding of the fate and transformation of mercury in the atmosphere is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Mercury-dependent artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is the largest source of mercury pollution on Earth. In this practice, elemental mercury is used  to extract gold from ore as an amalgam. The amalgam is typically isolated by hand  and then heated-often with a torch or over a stove-to distill the mercury and  isolate the gold. Mercury release from tailings and vaporized mercury exceed  1000 tonnes each year from ASGM. The health effects on the miners are dire, with  inhaled mercury leading to neurological damage and other health issues. The  communities near these mines are also affected due to mercury contamination of  water and soil and subsequent accumulation in food staples, such as fish-a major  source of dietary protein in many ASGM regions. The risks to children are also  substantial, with mercury emissions from ASGM resulting in both physical and  mental disabilities and compromised development. Between 10 and 19 million people  use mercury to mine for gold in more than 70 countries, making mercury pollution  from ASGM a global issue. With the Minamata Convention on Mercury entering force  this year, there is political motivation to help overcome the problem of mercury  in ASGM. In this effort, chemists can play a central role. Here, the problem of  mercury in ASGM is reviewed with a discussion on how the chemistry community can  contribute solutions. Introducing portable and low-cost mercury sensors,  inexpensive and scalable remediation technologies, novel methods to prevent  mercury uptake in fish and food crops, and efficient and easy-to-use mercury-free  mining techniques are all ways in which the chemistry community can help. To meet  these challenges, it is critical that new technologies or techniques are low-cost  and adaptable to the remote and under-resourced areas in which ASGM is most  common. The problem of mercury pollution in ASGM is inherently a chemistry  problem. We therefore encourage the chemistry community to consider and address  this issue that affects the health of millions of people.},

	abstract = {Background: Mercury (Hg) is used in gold mining to extract gold from ore by forming “amalgam”—a mixture composed of approximately equal parts mercury and gold. Approximately 15 million people, including approximately 3 million women and children, participate in artisanal small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in developing countries. Thirty-seven percent of global air emissions of Hg are produced by ASGM. The recently adopted Minamata Convention calls for nations to gather health data, train health-care workers, and raise awareness in regard to ASGM activity.

Objective: The purpose of our review was to evaluate the current literature regarding the health effects of Hg among those working and/or living in or near ASGM communities.

Methods: We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar for studies relating to health effects and biomarkers of Hg exposure in ASGM communities. Articles published from 1990 through December 2012 were evaluated for relevance.

Discussion: Studies reporting health assessments, kidney dysfunction, neurological disorders and symptoms, and immunotoxicity/autoimmune dysfunction in individuals living in or near an ASGM community were identified. More than 60 studies that measured biomarkers of Hg exposure in individuals living in or near ASGM communities were also identified. These studies, conducted in 19 different countries in South America, Asia, and Africa, demonstrated that hair and urine concentrations are well above World Health Organization health guidance values in ASGM communities.

Conclusions: ASGM workers and their families are exposed to Hg vapor, and workers, workers’ families, and residents of nearby and downstream communities are consuming fish heavily contaminated with methylmercury.

Passive air samplers (PAS) are an accessible method for monitoring gaseous elemental mercury (GEM). I tested the suitability of PAS for recording GEM gradients at widely varying scales. Vertical gradients on the scale of centimeters to tens of meters measured over soil and within a forest allowed for the observation of GEM uptake in growing vegetation, the determination of the air-surface exchange direction, and the estimation of evaporative fluxes from contaminated soil. When PAS were deployed above a field with known soil contamination, slightly different spatial contamination patterns suggest horizontal GEM advection. on a continental scale, the PAS were also used to map annually averaged GEM levels across South and Central America. Accounting for the effect of wind speed on the PAS sampling rate is necessary to distinguish small concentration differences.},

	abstract = {Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is an economic activity with pre-columbian roots in Perú. Today it continues to be practiced throughout the national territory, although it is concentrated in certain regions where ore bodies are most easily exploited. Most ASGM activity takes place informally and even illegally, characterized by large amounts of labour input and simple technologies. In recent years, the high price of gold has caused a significant growth in the sector and drawn increased attention to the issue of mercury used during the processing of gold bearing ores. In 2017, the Artisanal Gold Council conducted a national study to document mercury use in the sector and to develop baseline estimates for ASGM mercury emissions and releases. This study was carried out in partnership with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and with funding by the Global Environment Facility as part of a project to develop a national action plan for the ASGM sector in compliance with article 7 of the Minamata Convention on Mercury. The study relied on the methodology for estimating mercury use in ASGM developed by the Artisanal Gold Council and published as Developing Baseline Estimates for Mercury Use in Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining Communities: A Practical Guide (AGC, 2015). The work focused on the regions of Madre de Dios, Puno, Arequipa and Ayacucho as they account for approximately 94\% of the ASGM gold production in the country. The AGC estimates that approximately 148.77 tons of gold is produced by the Peruvian ASGM sector per year. Of this production 87.97\% is processed through amalgamation with mercury; the remaining 12\% relies primarily on cyanide treatment. The use of mercury in artisanal and small-scale gold mining in Perú results in the loss of 362.47 tons of mercury to the land, air and water annually. The mercury losses occur with the addition of mercury to gold bearing ores to create mercury / gold amalgams. Mercury is further lost to the environment when these amalgams are burned to recover the gold. The amount of mercury used and lost is a function in part of the type of ore deposit, the characteristics of the crude ore, the methods of exploitation and the experience of the operators. In all cases it has been found that the use of mercury recovery systems such as retorts is very limited and does not have a significant impact on overall mercury emissions. The region of Madre de Dios where, alluvial mining is practiced, sees the highest levels of gold production by the national ASGM sector and also the highest levels of emissions and releases of mercury (181 tons annually). This represents 50\% of the national total for mercury emissions and releases. Madre de Dios is followed by Arequipa and Puno with 21.9\% and 17.8\% of the national total of mercury emissions and releases from ASGM respectively. The great diversity of mining sites and processing methods means that there is a great variability in mercury loss ratios with respect to the amount of gold produced, so for example the lowest value (2.1 Hg : 1 Au) was found in the Huepethue area in Madre de Dios with the use of mechanized methods (sluice and frontal loader), while the highest loss ratio was found in Cháparra, Arequipa with the use of quimbaletes (8.7 Hg : 1 Au). The area of La Pampa in Madre de Dios is the main focus of emissions and releases with 40\% of the national total (145 tons annually), followed by Rinconada in Puno with 13\% (46 tons annually) and Secocha in Arequipa with 8\% (27.8 tons annually)},

	abstract = {Retinal degeneration is often progressive. This feature has provided a therapeutic window for intervention that may extend functional vision in patients. Even though this approach is feasible, few promising drug candidates are available. The scarcity of new drugs has motivated research to discover novel compounds through different sources. One such example is Schisandrin B (SchB), an active component isolated from the five-flavor fruit (Fructus Schisandrae) that is postulated in traditional Chinese medicines to exert prophylactic visual benefit. This SchB benefit was investigated in this study in pde6cw59, a zebrafish retinal-degeneration model. In this model, the pde6c gene (phosphodiesterase 6C, cGMP-specific, cone, alpha prime) carried a mutation which caused cone degeneration. This altered the local environment and caused the bystander rods to degenerate too. To test SchB on the pde6cw59 mutants, a treatment concentration was first determined that would not cause morphological defects, and would initiate known physiological response. Then, the mutants were treated with the optimized SchB concentration before the appearance of retinal degeneration at 3 days postfertilization (dpf). The light sensation of animals was evaluated at 6 dpf by the visual motor response (VMR), a visual startle that could be initiated by drastic light onset and offset. The results show that the VMR of pde6cw59 mutants towards light onset was enhanced by the SchB treatment, and that the initial phase of the enhancement was primarily mediated through the mutants’ eyes. Further immunostaining analysis indicates that the treatment specifically reduced the size of the abnormally large rods. These observations implicate an interesting hypothesis: that the morphologically-improved rods drive the observed VMR enhancement. Together, these investigations have identified a possible visual benefit of SchB on retinal degeneration, a benefit that can potentially be further developed to extend functional vision in patients.},

	abstract = {We use a global 3-D model of atmospheric mercury (GEOS-Chem) to interpret worldwide observations of total gaseous mercury (TGM) and reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) in terms of the constraints they provide on the chemical cycling and deposition of mercury. Our simulation including a global mercury source of 7000 Mg yr−1 and a TGM lifetime of 0.8 years reproduces the magnitude and large-scale variability of TGM observations at land sites. However, it cannot capture observations of high TGM from ship cruises, implying a problem either in the measurements or in our fundamental understanding of mercury sources. Observed TGM seasonal variation at northern midlatitudes is consistent with a photochemical oxidation for Hg(0) partly balanced by photochemical reduction of Hg(II). Observations of increasing RGM with altitude imply a long lifetime of Hg(II) in the free troposphere. We find in the model that Hg(II) dominates over Hg(0) in the upper troposphere and stratosphere and that subsidence is the principal source of Hg(II) at remote surface sites. RGM observations at Okinawa Island (Japan) show large diurnal variability implying fast deposition, which we propose is due to RGM uptake by sea-salt aerosols. Observed mercury wet deposition fluxes in the United States show a maximum in the southeast, which we attribute to photochemical oxidation of the global Hg(0) pool. They also show a secondary maximum in the industrial Midwest due to regional emissions that is underestimated in the model, possibly because of excessive dry deposition relative to wet (dry deposition accounts for 68\% of total mercury deposition in the United States in the model, but this is sensitive to the assumed phase of Hg(II)). We estimate that North American anthropogenic emissions contribute on average 20\% to U.S. mercury deposition.},

	abstract = {We develop a mechanistic representation of land-atmosphere cycling in a global 3-D ocean-atmosphere model of mercury (GEOS-Chem). The resulting land-ocean-atmosphere model is used to construct preindustrial and present biogeochemical cycles of mercury, to examine the legacy of past anthropogenic emissions, to map anthropogenic enrichment factors for deposition, and to attribute mercury deposition in the United States. Land emission in the model includes prompt recycling of recently deposited mercury (600 Mg a−1 for present day), soil volatilization (550 Mg a−1), and evapotranspiration (550 Mg a−1). The spatial distribution of soil concentrations is derived from local steady state between land emission and deposition in the preindustrial simulation, augmented for the present day by a 15\% increase in the soil reservoir distributed following the pattern of anthropogenic deposition. Mercury deposition and hence emission are predicted to be highest in the subtropics. Our atmospheric lifetime of mercury against deposition (0.50 year) is shorter than past estimates because of our accounting of Hg(0) dry deposition, but recycling from surface reservoirs results in an effective lifetime of 1.6 years against transfer to long-lived reservoirs in the soil and deep ocean. Present-day anthropogenic enrichment of mercury deposition exceeds a factor of 5 in continental source regions. We estimate that 68\% of the deposition over the United States is anthropogenic, including 20\% from North American emissions (20\% primary and {\textless}1\% recycled through surface reservoirs), 31\% from emissions outside North America (22\% primary and 9\% recycled), and 16\% from the legacy of anthropogenic mercury accumulated in soils and the deep ocean.},

	abstract = {We present a first description and evaluation of GEOS-CHEM, a global threedimensional (3-D) model of tropospheric chemistry driven by assimilated meteorological observations from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) of the NASA Data Assimilation Office (DAO). The model is applied to a 1-year simulation of tropospheric ozone-NOx-hydrocarbon chemistry for 1994, and is evaluated with observations both for 1994 and for other years. It reproduces usually to within 10 ppb the concentrations of ozone observed from the worldwide ozonesonde data network. It simulates correctly the seasonal phases and amplitudes of ozone concentrations for different regions and altitudes, but tends to underestimate the seasonal amplitude at northern midlatitudes. Observed concentrations of NO and peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) observed in aircraft campaigns are generally reproduced to within a factor of 2 and often much better. Concentrations of HNO3 in the remote troposphere are overestimated typically by a factor of 2–3, a common problem in global models that may reflect a combination of insufficient precipitation scavenging and gas-aerosol partitioning not resolved by the model. The model yields an atmospheric lifetime of methylchloroform (proxy for global OH) of 5.1 years, as compared to a best estimate from observations of 5.5 +/− 0.8 years, and simulates H2O2 concentrations observed from aircraft with significant regional disagreements but no global bias. The OH concentrations are ∼20\% higher than in our previous global 3-D model which included an UV-absorbing aerosol. Concentrations of CO tend to be underestimated by the model, often by 10–30 ppb, which could reflect a combination of excessive OH (a 20\% decrease in model OH could be accommodated by the methylchloroform constraint) and an underestimate of CO sources (particularly biogenic). The model underestimates observed acetone concentrations over the South Pacific in fall by a factor of 3; a missing source from the ocean may be implicated.},

          , 
            
              Mercury (Hg), a neurotoxic heavy metal, is transferred to marine and terrestrial ecosystems through atmospheric transport. Recent studies have highlighted the role of vegetation uptake as a sink for atmospheric elemental mercury (Hg
              0
              ) and a source of Hg to soils. However, the global magnitude of the Hg
              0
              vegetation uptake flux is highly uncertain, with estimates ranging 1000–4000 Mg per year. To constrain this sink, we compare simulations in the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem with a compiled database of litterfall, throughfall, and flux tower measurements from 93 forested sites. The prior version of GEOS-Chem predicts median Hg
              0
              dry deposition velocities similar to litterfall measurements from Northern hemisphere temperate and boreal forests (∼0.03 cm s
              −1
              ), yet it underestimates measurements from a flux tower study (0.04 cm s
              −1
              vs.
              0.07 cm s
              −1
              ) and Amazon litterfall (0.05 cm s
              −1
              vs.
              0.17 cm s
              −1
              ). After revising the Hg
              0
              reactivity within the dry deposition parametrization to match flux tower and Amazon measurements, GEOS-Chem displays improved agreement with the seasonality of atmospheric Hg
              0
              observations in the Northern midlatitudes. Additionally, the modelled bias in Hg
              0
              concentrations in South America decreases from +0.21 ng m
              −3
              to +0.05 ng m
              −3
              . We calculate a global flux of Hg
              0
              dry deposition to land of 2276 Mg per year, approximately double previous model estimates. The Amazon rainforest contributes 29\% of the total Hg
              0
              land sink, yet continued deforestation and climate change threatens the rainforest's stability and thus its role as an important Hg sink. In an illustrative worst-case scenario where the Amazon is completely converted to savannah, GEOS-Chem predicts that an additional 283 Mg Hg per year would deposit to the ocean, where it can bioaccumulate in the marine food chain. Biosphere–atmosphere interactions thus play a crucial role in global Hg cycling and should be considered in assessments of future Hg pollution.},

In our systematic review of related literature, we aim to determine if children of alluvial gold miners were at risk of exposure to methyl mercury toxicity through dietary exposure. This was achieved through applying Cochrane PICO methodology for the research question. We selected only the most relevant articles from the thousands of articles that were generated by the Divine Word University (DWU) electronic data base system for our review. Further screening questions were applied based on the CASP method which filtered remaining 105 to only 9 papers for the review. The results from the nine (N = 9) studies analysed showed convincing results of the association between consumption of fish contaminated with methyl mercury and poor growth and development in children whose parents lived near mining sites. We conclude that since mercury is the predominant element used in the extraction of gold in alluvial mining, it is an exposure pathway for methyl mercury toxicity for children through dietary exposure.},

Rapidly increasing global prices for gold are causing a massive upsurge in artisanal mining in the Peruvian Amazon, considered to be one of the most biodiverse places on the planet. This study identifies the current levels of mercury in the human population, through identifying levels of total mercury in human hair in mining zones of Madre de Dios Department and in the nearby city of Puerto Maldonado. A regression analysis reveals that fish consumption, gender, and location of residence were significant indicators of mercury levels; while duration of residence and age had no significant relationship to mercury levels. Increased fish consumption levels were the strongest indicators of increased total mercury levels across the entire population. The levels of total mercury in hair was significantly (a = 0.05) higher in mining zones, than Puerto Maldonado. In both areas men had significantly higher levels than women, likely due to a difference in metabolism or varying levels of direct involvement in gold mining- a male predominated industry. This is the first study to show the health threat that mercury poses to this region, however further research needs to be done to gain a more refined understanding of the predominant routes of exposure in this population.},

Managing boundaries between disciplines, across scales of geography and jurisdiction, and between different forms of knowledge is also often critical to transferring information.

Presenting research on water management regimes in the United States, international agricultural research systems, El Niño forecasting systems in the Pacific and southern Africa, and fisheries in the North Atlantic, this paper explores: 1) how effective boundary work involves creating salient, credible, and legitimate information simultaneously for multiple audiences; 2) the thresholds, complementarities and tradeoffs between salience, credibility, and legitimacy when crossing boundaries; and 3) propositions for institutional mechanisms in boundary organizations which effectively balance tradeoffs, take advantage on complementarities, and reach thresholds of salience, credibility, and legitimacy.},

We give advice on method choice, tuning for performance, methods for initialization, tests of convergence, troubleshooting, and use of the chain output to produce or report parameter estimates with associated uncertainties. We argue that autocorrelation time is the most important test for convergence, as it directly connects to the uncertainty on the sampling estimate of any quantity of interest.

The adjoint computes the sensitivity of ozone concentrations at the receptor sites to ozone production rates at 2° × 2.5° resolution over the history of air parcels reaching the site. MBO experiences distinct Asian ozone pollution episodes; most of the ozone production in these episodes takes place over East Asia with maxima over northeast China and southern Japan, adding to a diffuse background production distributed over the extratropical northern hemisphere. TH shows the same Asian origins for ozone as MBO but no distinct Asian pollution episodes. We find that transpacific pollution plumes transported in the free troposphere are diluted by a factor of 3 when entrained into the boundary layer, explaining why these plumes are undetectable in U.S. surface air.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric transport models can be used to infer surface fluxes of atmospheric CO2 from observed concentrations using inverse methods. One of the main problem of these methods is the question of their sensivity to all the parameters involved in the calculation. In this paper we study precisely the influence of the main parameters on the net CO2 fluxes inferred by an annual Bayesian three-dimensional (3-D) inversion of atmospheric CO2 monthly concentrations. This inversion is described as the control inversion (S0) of Bousquet et al. [this issue]. Successively, at regional to global spatial scales we analyze the numerical stability of the solution to initial fluxes and errors, the influence of a priori flux scenario, the sensitivity to the atmospheric transport model used, the influence of δ13C measurements, and the influence of the atmospheric network. We find that the atmospheric transport model introduces a large uncertainty to the inferred budget, which overcomes our control run uncertainties. The effects of vertical transport on CO2 concentrations appear to be a critical point that has to be investigated further. Spatial patterns of fluxes also have significant influence on a regional basis. We notice that accounting for the Baltic Sea station (BAL) deeply modifies the Europe versus Asia partition of the land uptake at mid and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. We also analyze the weak influence of using δ13C measurements as additional constraints. In the tropics we find that the low level of constraints imposed by the atmospheric network limits the analysis of fluxes to zonal means. Finally, we calculate overall estimates of CO2 net sources and sinks at continental scale, accounting for all sensivity tests. Concerning the controversial partition of CO2 sink at mid and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, we find (on average, for the 1985–1995 period) an overall partition of the sink of 0.7±0.7 Gt C yr1 for North America, 0.2±0.3 Gt C yr−1 for the North Pacific Ocean, 0.5±0.8 Gt C yr−1 for Europe, 0.7±0.3 Gt C yr−1 for the North Atlantic Ocean, and 1.2±0.8 Gt C yr−1 for north Asia. This overall partition tends to place an important land uptake over north Asia. However, uncertainties remain large when we account for all the sensitivity tests.},

Evaluating the effectiveness of the Convention (as required by Article 22) is a crucial component to ensure that it meets this objective.

The use of existing biotic Hg data will deﬁne spatial gradients (e.g., biological mercury hotspots), baselines to develop relevant temporal trends, and an ability to assess risk to taxa and human communities of greatest concern. We also recommend the development of a technical document that describes monitoring options for the Conference of Parties, to provide science-based standardized guidelines for collecting relevant monitoring information, as guided by Article 19.},

Altiplano and the Amazon rainforest. For the first 11 months of
measurements, we obtained a mean TGM concentration of 0.89±0.01 ng m−3, which is in good agreement with the sparse amount of data available from
the continent. For the remaining 9 months, we obtained a significantly
higher TGM concentration of 1.34±0.01 ng m−3, a difference which
we tentatively attribute to the strong El Niño event of 2015–2016.
Based on HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) back trajectories and clustering techniques, we show that
lower mean TGM concentrations were linked to either westerly Altiplanic air
masses or those originating from the lowlands to the southeast of CHC.
Elevated TGM concentrations were related to northerly air masses of
Amazonian or southerly air masses of Altiplanic origin, with the former possibly
linked to artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM), whereas the latter
might be explained by volcanic activity. We observed a marked seasonal
pattern, with low TGM concentrations in the dry season (austral winter),
rising concentrations during the biomass burning (BB) season, and the highest
concentrations at the beginning of the wet season (austral summer). With the
help of simultaneously sampled equivalent black carbon (eBC) and carbon
monoxide (CO) data, we use the clearly BB-influenced signal during the BB season
(August to October) to derive a mean TGM / CO emission ratio of (2.3±0.6)×10-7 ppbvTGM ppbvCO-1, which could be used to
constrain South American BB emissions. Through the link with CO2 measured in situ and remotely sensed solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) as
proxies for vegetation activity, we detect signs of a vegetation sink effect
in Amazonian air masses and derive a “best guess” TGM / CO2 uptake ratio of 0.058 ±0.017 (ng m−3)TGM ppmCO2-1. Finally, significantly
higher Hg concentrations in western Altiplanic air masses during the wet
season compared with the dry season point towards the modulation of
atmospheric Hg by the eastern Pacific Ocean.},

              A global surge in ‘artisanal’, smallscale mining (ASM) threatens biodiverse tropical forests and exposes residents to dangerous levels of mercury. In response, governments and development agencies are investing millions (USD) on ASM
              formalization
              ; registering concessions and demarcating extraction zones to promote regulatory adherence and direct mining away from ecologically sensitive areas. The environmental outcomes of these initiatives are seldom systematically assessed. We examine patterns of mining-related deforestation associated with formalization efforts in a gold-rich region of the Peruvian Amazon. We track changes from 2001 to 2014 when agencies: (a) issued 1701 provisional titles and (b) tried to restrict mining to a {\textgreater}5000 km
              2
              ‘corridor’. We use fixed-effect regression models and matching methods to control for gold price, geology, and accessibility. Mining increased dramatically during this period, clearing ∼40 000 ha of forest. After the mining corridor was declared and enforcement increased, new mining sites were opened more frequently within titled areas and inside the corridor than elsewhere. However, mining also increased in protected area buffer zones and native communities, and the proportion of mining area occurring outside the corridor grew, concentrated in a few hotspots. Interviews (
              n
              = 47) revealed that the hoped-for regulatory adherence failed to materialize because miners who were issued provisional titles started operations without complying with attendant environmental rules. Overlapping land claims for agriculture and forest extraction proved a major obstacle for obtaining full legal rights to mine. Miners resented the slow, costly formalization process but many sought titles to bolster territorial claims, avoid policing, obtain credit and recruit paying ‘guest’ miners who generally ignored regulations. We find that responses to formalization varied with changing context and while formalization may curb mining in some circumstances, it may exacerbate it in others. Without adequate enforcement, interagency coordination, and attention to competing land claims, formalizing ASM may accelerate ecological destruction.},

	abstract = {Ratification of the Minamata Convention on Mercury has led to the establishment of Peruvian regulations limiting mercury concentrations in air to 2000 ng/m3over a 24-hr measurement period. As a result, three communities in Madre de Dios, Peru were mapped during October 2017 to determine Hg0 vapor concentrations in the air. The town of Tres Islas exhibited Hg0 concentrations less than 200 ng/m3: the minimum risk level defined by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. These low concentrations were reflective of a town in the region with limited exposure to artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM). However, the ASGM communities of Laberinto and Delta One exhibited concentrations of Hg0 vapor that exceeded 2,000,000 ng/m3 surrounding active gold shops, where amalgams and processed amalgams were heated with open flames. Laberinto was reevaluated in May 2018 during which time Hg0 levels on the sidewalks in front of gold shops again exceeded 2,000,000 ng/m3. Within the scope of this paper a rapid mapping technique allows for the detection of sources of Hg0 pollution and identifies neighborhoods that require intervention to decrease Hg0 emissions. In addition, this work highlights the difficulties of measuring total gaseous mercury in ASGM communities with gold shops according to the Peruvian law.},

            Mercury is a globally transported pollutant with potent neurotoxic effects for both humans and wildlife. This study introduces an assessment method to estimate the potential human health-related economic benefits of global and domestic mercury control policies. It finds that for the US population as a whole, global mercury controls could lead to approximately twice the benefits of domestic action by 2050. This result is robust to several uncertainties and variabilities along the emissions-to-impacts path, although we find that those consuming locally caught freshwater fish in the United States could benefit more from domestic action.
          , 
            Mercury pollution poses risks for both human and ecosystem health. As a consequence, controlling mercury pollution has become a policy goal on both global and national scales. We developed an assessment method linking global-scale atmospheric chemical transport modeling to regional-scale economic modeling to consistently evaluate the potential benefits to the United States of global (UN Minamata Convention on Mercury) and domestic [Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS)] policies, framed as economic gains from avoiding mercury-related adverse health endpoints. This method attempts to trace the policies-to-impacts path while taking into account uncertainties and knowledge gaps with policy-appropriate bounding assumptions. We project that cumulative lifetime benefits from the Minamata Convention for individuals affected by 2050 are \$339 billion (2005 USD), with a range from \$1.4 billion to \$575 billion in our sensitivity scenarios. Cumulative economy-wide benefits to the United States, realized by 2050, are \$104 billion, with a range from \$6 million to \$171 billion. Projected Minamata benefits are more than twice those projected from the domestic policy. This relative benefit is robust to several uncertainties and variabilities, with the ratio of benefits (Minamata/MATS) ranging from ≈1.4 to 3. However, we find that for those consuming locally caught freshwater fish from the United States, rather than marine and estuarine fish from the global market, benefits are larger from US than global action, suggesting domestic policies are important for protecting these populations. Per megagram of prevented emissions, our domestic policy scenario results in US benefits about an order of magnitude higher than from our global scenario, further highlighting the importance of domestic action.},

	abstract = {Speciated mercury gridded emissions inventories together with chemical transport models and concentration measurements are essential when investigating both the effectiveness of mitigation measures and the mercury cycle in the environment. Since different mercury species have contrasting behaviour in the atmosphere, their proportion in anthropogenic emissions could determine the spatial impacts. In this study, the time series from 1970 to 2012 of the EDGARv4.tox2 global mercury emissions inventory are described; the total global mercury emission in 2010 is 1772 tonnes. Global grid-maps with geospatial distribution of mercury emissions at a 0.1° × 0.1° resolution are provided for each year. Compared to the previous tox1 version, tox2 provides updates for more recent years and improved emissions in particular for agricultural waste burning, power generation and artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) sectors. We have also developed three retrospective emissions scenarios based on different hypotheses related to the proportion of mercury species in the total mercury emissions for each activity sector; improvements in emissions speciation are seen when using information primarily from field measurements. We evaluated them using the GEOS-Chem 3-D mercury model in order to explore the influence of speciation shifts, to reactive mercury forms in particular, on regional wet deposition patterns. The reference scenario S1 (EDGARv4.tox2\_S1) uses speciation factors from the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP); scenario S2 (“EPA\_power”) uses factors from EPA's Information Collection Request (ICR); and scenario S3 (“Asia\_filedM”) factors from recent scientific publications. In the reference scenario, the sum of reactive mercury emissions (Hg-P and Hg2+) accounted for 25.3\% of the total global emissions; the regions/countries that have shares of reactive mercury emissions higher than 6\% in total global reactive mercury are China+ (30.9\%), India+ (12.5\%) and the United States (9.9\%). In 2010, the variations of reactive mercury emissions amongst the different scenarios are in the range of −19.3 t/yr (China+) to 4.4 t/yr (OECD\_Europe). However, at the sector level, the variation could be different, e.g., for the iron and steel industry in China reaches 15.4 t/yr. Model evaluation at the global level shows a variation of approximately ±10\% in wet deposition for the three emissions scenarios. An evaluation of the impact of mercury speciation within nested grid sensitivity simulations is performed for the United States and modelled wet deposition fluxes are compared with measurements. These studies show that using the S2 and S3 emissions of reactive mercury, can improve wet deposition estimates near sources.},

This paper reports findings from an environmental analysis undertaken directly within three small-scale gold mining sites in Ghana. Using targeted soil and water sampling analysed through mass spectrometry, the findings are compared with findings in the literature and safety guidelines to gauge the scale of contamination at surveyed sites. The analysis reveals that there is widespread pollution, often several orders higher than background levels.

Miners can choose between Chilean-mill processing centers, where the ore is ground, concentrated and amalgamated, or “Chancha” Centers, where the whole ore is amalgamated. By weighing mercury before and after all unit operations involved in the amalgamation process, it was possible to determine mercury losses. Analyses in eight centers indicated that 51–59\% of mercury introduced into the amalgamation process is recovered when miners squeeze the excess mercury. Around 29\% of total mercury is lost when miners burn amalgam and gold is melted, and 15\% is lost with the tailings. When only gravity concentrates are amalgamated, 1.4\% of mercury entering the process is lost with tailings, whereas 29.5\% is lost when the whole ore is amalgamated. Approximately 1.5 tonnes/annum of mercury is released in Portovelo-Zaruma, from which 70\% is evaporated and 30\% is released with tailings. Mercury-contaminated tailings are leached with cyanide in agitated tanks. A large majority of the processing centers dispose the final tailings with mercury and cyanide into the Calera River and Amarillo River. Mercury dissolved with cyanide likely becomes more bioavailable than metallic mercury. A campaign for reducing mercury emissions must focus on the use of individual retorts – mercury pollution control devices – and the elimination of whole ore amalgamation.},

On the basis of this result, the average ratio of Hg lost to Au produced in ASGM was estimated to be 1.96 in Africa, 4.63 in Latin America, and 1.23 in Asia. The difference among regions can be attributed to the amalgamation procedure used by the miners, in which whole-ore amalgamation is predominant in Latin America and Asia. The obtained estimated ratio of Hglost:Auproduced suggested the possibility to detect either Au or Hg smuggling from one country to another.
