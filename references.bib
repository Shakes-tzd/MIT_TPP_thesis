	abstract = {Mercury-dependent artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is the largest source of mercury pollution on Earth. In this practice, elemental mercury is used  to extract gold from ore as an amalgam. The amalgam is typically isolated by hand  and then heated-often with a torch or over a stove-to distill the mercury and  isolate the gold. Mercury release from tailings and vaporized mercury exceed  1000 tonnes each year from ASGM. The health effects on the miners are dire, with  inhaled mercury leading to neurological damage and other health issues. The  communities near these mines are also affected due to mercury contamination of  water and soil and subsequent accumulation in food staples, such as fish-a major  source of dietary protein in many ASGM regions. The risks to children are also  substantial, with mercury emissions from ASGM resulting in both physical and  mental disabilities and compromised development. Between 10 and 19 million people  use mercury to mine for gold in more than 70 countries, making mercury pollution  from ASGM a global issue. With the Minamata Convention on Mercury entering force  this year, there is political motivation to help overcome the problem of mercury  in ASGM. In this effort, chemists can play a central role. Here, the problem of  mercury in ASGM is reviewed with a discussion on how the chemistry community can  contribute solutions. Introducing portable and low-cost mercury sensors,  inexpensive and scalable remediation technologies, novel methods to prevent  mercury uptake in fish and food crops, and efficient and easy-to-use mercury-free  mining techniques are all ways in which the chemistry community can help. To meet  these challenges, it is critical that new technologies or techniques are low-cost  and adaptable to the remote and under-resourced areas in which ASGM is most  common. The problem of mercury pollution in ASGM is inherently a chemistry  problem. We therefore encourage the chemistry community to consider and address  this issue that affects the health of millions of people.},

	abstract = {Background: Mercury (Hg) is used in gold mining to extract gold from ore by forming “amalgam”—a mixture composed of approximately equal parts mercury and gold. Approximately 15 million people, including approximately 3 million women and children, participate in artisanal small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in developing countries. Thirty-seven percent of global air emissions of Hg are produced by ASGM. The recently adopted Minamata Convention calls for nations to gather health data, train health-care workers, and raise awareness in regard to ASGM activity.

Objective: The purpose of our review was to evaluate the current literature regarding the health effects of Hg among those working and/or living in or near ASGM communities.

Methods: We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar for studies relating to health effects and biomarkers of Hg exposure in ASGM communities. Articles published from 1990 through December 2012 were evaluated for relevance.

Discussion: Studies reporting health assessments, kidney dysfunction, neurological disorders and symptoms, and immunotoxicity/autoimmune dysfunction in individuals living in or near an ASGM community were identified. More than 60 studies that measured biomarkers of Hg exposure in individuals living in or near ASGM communities were also identified. These studies, conducted in 19 different countries in South America, Asia, and Africa, demonstrated that hair and urine concentrations are well above World Health Organization health guidance values in ASGM communities.

Conclusions: ASGM workers and their families are exposed to Hg vapor, and workers, workers’ families, and residents of nearby and downstream communities are consuming fish heavily contaminated with methylmercury.

	abstract = {Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is an economic activity with pre-columbian roots in Perú. Today it continues to be practiced throughout the national territory, although it is concentrated in certain regions where ore bodies are most easily exploited. Most ASGM activity takes place informally and even illegally, characterized by large amounts of labour input and simple technologies. In recent years, the high price of gold has caused a significant growth in the sector and drawn increased attention to the issue of mercury used during the processing of gold bearing ores. In 2017, the Artisanal Gold Council conducted a national study to document mercury use in the sector and to develop baseline estimates for ASGM mercury emissions and releases. This study was carried out in partnership with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and with funding by the Global Environment Facility as part of a project to develop a national action plan for the ASGM sector in compliance with article 7 of the Minamata Convention on Mercury. The study relied on the methodology for estimating mercury use in ASGM developed by the Artisanal Gold Council and published as Developing Baseline Estimates for Mercury Use in Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining Communities: A Practical Guide (AGC, 2015). The work focused on the regions of Madre de Dios, Puno, Arequipa and Ayacucho as they account for approximately 94\% of the ASGM gold production in the country. The AGC estimates that approximately 148.77 tons of gold is produced by the Peruvian ASGM sector per year. Of this production 87.97\% is processed through amalgamation with mercury; the remaining 12\% relies primarily on cyanide treatment. The use of mercury in artisanal and small-scale gold mining in Perú results in the loss of 362.47 tons of mercury to the land, air and water annually. The mercury losses occur with the addition of mercury to gold bearing ores to create mercury / gold amalgams. Mercury is further lost to the environment when these amalgams are burned to recover the gold. The amount of mercury used and lost is a function in part of the type of ore deposit, the characteristics of the crude ore, the methods of exploitation and the experience of the operators. In all cases it has been found that the use of mercury recovery systems such as retorts is very limited and does not have a significant impact on overall mercury emissions. The region of Madre de Dios where, alluvial mining is practiced, sees the highest levels of gold production by the national ASGM sector and also the highest levels of emissions and releases of mercury (181 tons annually). This represents 50\% of the national total for mercury emissions and releases. Madre de Dios is followed by Arequipa and Puno with 21.9\% and 17.8\% of the national total of mercury emissions and releases from ASGM respectively. The great diversity of mining sites and processing methods means that there is a great variability in mercury loss ratios with respect to the amount of gold produced, so for example the lowest value (2.1 Hg : 1 Au) was found in the Huepethue area in Madre de Dios with the use of mechanized methods (sluice and frontal loader), while the highest loss ratio was found in Cháparra, Arequipa with the use of quimbaletes (8.7 Hg : 1 Au). The area of La Pampa in Madre de Dios is the main focus of emissions and releases with 40\% of the national total (145 tons annually), followed by Rinconada in Puno with 13\% (46 tons annually) and Secocha in Arequipa with 8\% (27.8 tons annually)},

	abstract = {Retinal degeneration is often progressive. This feature has provided a therapeutic window for intervention that may extend functional vision in patients. Even though this approach is feasible, few promising drug candidates are available. The scarcity of new drugs has motivated research to discover novel compounds through different sources. One such example is Schisandrin B (SchB), an active component isolated from the five-flavor fruit (Fructus Schisandrae) that is postulated in traditional Chinese medicines to exert prophylactic visual benefit. This SchB benefit was investigated in this study in pde6cw59, a zebrafish retinal-degeneration model. In this model, the pde6c gene (phosphodiesterase 6C, cGMP-specific, cone, alpha prime) carried a mutation which caused cone degeneration. This altered the local environment and caused the bystander rods to degenerate too. To test SchB on the pde6cw59 mutants, a treatment concentration was first determined that would not cause morphological defects, and would initiate known physiological response. Then, the mutants were treated with the optimized SchB concentration before the appearance of retinal degeneration at 3 days postfertilization (dpf). The light sensation of animals was evaluated at 6 dpf by the visual motor response (VMR), a visual startle that could be initiated by drastic light onset and offset. The results show that the VMR of pde6cw59 mutants towards light onset was enhanced by the SchB treatment, and that the initial phase of the enhancement was primarily mediated through the mutants’ eyes. Further immunostaining analysis indicates that the treatment specifically reduced the size of the abnormally large rods. These observations implicate an interesting hypothesis: that the morphologically-improved rods drive the observed VMR enhancement. Together, these investigations have identified a possible visual benefit of SchB on retinal degeneration, a benefit that can potentially be further developed to extend functional vision in patients.},

	abstract = {We use a global 3-D model of atmospheric mercury (GEOS-Chem) to interpret worldwide observations of total gaseous mercury (TGM) and reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) in terms of the constraints they provide on the chemical cycling and deposition of mercury. Our simulation including a global mercury source of 7000 Mg yr−1 and a TGM lifetime of 0.8 years reproduces the magnitude and large-scale variability of TGM observations at land sites. However, it cannot capture observations of high TGM from ship cruises, implying a problem either in the measurements or in our fundamental understanding of mercury sources. Observed TGM seasonal variation at northern midlatitudes is consistent with a photochemical oxidation for Hg(0) partly balanced by photochemical reduction of Hg(II). Observations of increasing RGM with altitude imply a long lifetime of Hg(II) in the free troposphere. We find in the model that Hg(II) dominates over Hg(0) in the upper troposphere and stratosphere and that subsidence is the principal source of Hg(II) at remote surface sites. RGM observations at Okinawa Island (Japan) show large diurnal variability implying fast deposition, which we propose is due to RGM uptake by sea-salt aerosols. Observed mercury wet deposition fluxes in the United States show a maximum in the southeast, which we attribute to photochemical oxidation of the global Hg(0) pool. They also show a secondary maximum in the industrial Midwest due to regional emissions that is underestimated in the model, possibly because of excessive dry deposition relative to wet (dry deposition accounts for 68\% of total mercury deposition in the United States in the model, but this is sensitive to the assumed phase of Hg(II)). We estimate that North American anthropogenic emissions contribute on average 20\% to U.S. mercury deposition.},

The resulting land-ocean-atmosphere model is used to construct preindustrial and present biogeochemical cycles of mercury, to examine the legacy of past anthropogenic emissions, to map anthropogenic enrichment factors for deposition, and to attribute mercury deposition in the United States. Land emission in the model includes prompt recycling of recently deposited mercury (600 Mg a−1 for present day), soil volatilization (550 Mg a−1), and evapotranspiration (550 Mg a−1). The spatial distribution of soil concentrations is derived from local steady state between land emission and deposition in the preindustrial simulation, augmented for the present day by a 15\% increase in the soil reservoir distributed following the pattern of anthropogenic deposition. Mercury deposition and hence emission are predicted to be highest in the subtropics. Our atmospheric lifetime of mercury against deposition (0.50 year) is shorter than past estimates because of our accounting of Hg(0) dry deposition, but recycling from surface reservoirs results in an effective lifetime of 1.6 years against transfer to long-lived reservoirs in the soil and deep ocean. Present-day anthropogenic enrichment of mercury deposition exceeds a factor of 5 in continental source regions. We estimate that 68\% of the deposition over the United States is anthropogenic, including 20\% from North American emissions (20\% primary and {\textless}1\% recycled through surface reservoirs), 31\% from emissions outside North America (22\% primary and 9\% recycled), and 16\% from the legacy of anthropogenic mercury accumulated in soils and the deep ocean.},

The model is applied to a 1-year simulation of tropospheric ozone-NOx-hydrocarbon chemistry for 1994, and is evaluated with observations both for 1994 and for other years. It reproduces usually to within 10 ppb the concentrations of ozone observed from the worldwide ozonesonde data network. It simulates correctly the seasonal phases and amplitudes of ozone concentrations for different regions and altitudes, but tends to underestimate the seasonal amplitude at northern midlatitudes. Observed concentrations of NO and peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) observed in aircraft campaigns are generally reproduced to within a factor of 2 and often much better. Concentrations of HNO3 in the remote troposphere are overestimated typically by a factor of 2–3, a common problem in global models that may reflect a combination of insufficient precipitation scavenging and gas-aerosol partitioning not resolved by the model. The model yields an atmospheric lifetime of methylchloroform (proxy for global OH) of 5.1 years, as compared to a best estimate from observations of 5.5 +/− 0.8 years, and simulates H2O2 concentrations observed from aircraft with significant regional disagreements but no global bias. The OH concentrations are ∼20\% higher than in our previous global 3-D model which included an UV-absorbing aerosol. Concentrations of CO tend to be underestimated by the model, often by 10–30 ppb, which could reflect a combination of excessive OH (a 20\% decrease in model OH could be accommodated by the methylchloroform constraint) and an underestimate of CO sources (particularly biogenic). The model underestimates observed acetone concentrations over the South Pacific in fall by a factor of 3; a missing source from the ocean may be implicated.},

              land sink, yet continued deforestation and climate change threatens the rainforest's stability and thus its role as an important Hg sink. In an illustrative worst-case scenario where the Amazon is completely converted to savannah, GEOS-Chem predicts that an additional 283 Mg Hg per year would deposit to the ocean, where it can bioaccumulate in the marine food chain. Biosphere–atmosphere interactions thus play a crucial role in global Hg cycling and should be considered in assessments of future Hg pollution.},

In our systematic review of related literature, we aim to determine if children of alluvial gold miners were at risk of exposure to methyl mercury toxicity through dietary exposure. This was achieved through applying Cochrane PICO methodology for the research question. We selected only the most relevant articles from the thousands of articles that were generated by the Divine Word University (DWU) electronic data base system for our review. Further screening questions were applied based on the CASP method which filtered remaining 105 to only 9 papers for the review. The results from the nine (N = 9) studies analysed showed convincing results of the association between consumption of fish contaminated with methyl mercury and poor growth and development in children whose parents lived near mining sites. We conclude that since mercury is the predominant element used in the extraction of gold in alluvial mining, it is an exposure pathway for methyl mercury toxicity for children through dietary exposure.},

Rapidly increasing global prices for gold are causing a massive upsurge in artisanal mining in the Peruvian Amazon, considered to be one of the most biodiverse places on the planet. This study identifies the current levels of mercury in the human population, through identifying levels of total mercury in human hair in mining zones of Madre de Dios Department and in the nearby city of Puerto Maldonado. A regression analysis reveals that fish consumption, gender, and location of residence were significant indicators of mercury levels; while duration of residence and age had no significant relationship to mercury levels. Increased fish consumption levels were the strongest indicators of increased total mercury levels across the entire population. The levels of total mercury in hair was significantly (a = 0.05) higher in mining zones, than Puerto Maldonado. In both areas men had significantly higher levels than women, likely due to a difference in metabolism or varying levels of direct involvement in gold mining- a male predominated industry. This is the first study to show the health threat that mercury poses to this region, however further research needs to be done to gain a more refined understanding of the predominant routes of exposure in this population.},

Managing boundaries between disciplines, across scales of geography and jurisdiction, and between different forms of knowledge is also often critical to transferring information.

Presenting research on water management regimes in the United States, international agricultural research systems, El Niño forecasting systems in the Pacific and southern Africa, and fisheries in the North Atlantic, this paper explores: 1) how effective boundary work involves creating salient, credible, and legitimate information simultaneously for multiple audiences; 2) the thresholds, complementarities and tradeoffs between salience, credibility, and legitimacy when crossing boundaries; and 3) propositions for institutional mechanisms in boundary organizations which effectively balance tradeoffs, take advantage on complementarities, and reach thresholds of salience, credibility, and legitimacy.},

We give advice on method choice, tuning for performance, methods for initialization, tests of convergence, troubleshooting, and use of the chain output to produce or report parameter estimates with associated uncertainties. We argue that autocorrelation time is the most important test for convergence, as it directly connects to the uncertainty on the sampling estimate of any quantity of interest.

The adjoint computes the sensitivity of ozone concentrations at the receptor sites to ozone production rates at 2° × 2.5° resolution over the history of air parcels reaching the site. MBO experiences distinct Asian ozone pollution episodes; most of the ozone production in these episodes takes place over East Asia with maxima over northeast China and southern Japan, adding to a diffuse background production distributed over the extratropical northern hemisphere. TH shows the same Asian origins for ozone as MBO but no distinct Asian pollution episodes. We find that transpacific pollution plumes transported in the free troposphere are diluted by a factor of 3 when entrained into the boundary layer, explaining why these plumes are undetectable in U.S. surface air.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric transport models can be used to infer surface fluxes of atmospheric CO2 from observed concentrations using inverse methods. One of the main problem of these methods is the question of their sensivity to all the parameters involved in the calculation. In this paper we study precisely the influence of the main parameters on the net CO2 fluxes inferred by an annual Bayesian three-dimensional (3-D) inversion of atmospheric CO2 monthly concentrations. This inversion is described as the control inversion (S0) of Bousquet et al. [this issue]. Successively, at regional to global spatial scales we analyze the numerical stability of the solution to initial fluxes and errors, the influence of a priori flux scenario, the sensitivity to the atmospheric transport model used, the influence of δ13C measurements, and the influence of the atmospheric network. We find that the atmospheric transport model introduces a large uncertainty to the inferred budget, which overcomes our control run uncertainties. The effects of vertical transport on CO2 concentrations appear to be a critical point that has to be investigated further. Spatial patterns of fluxes also have significant influence on a regional basis. We notice that accounting for the Baltic Sea station (BAL) deeply modifies the Europe versus Asia partition of the land uptake at mid and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. We also analyze the weak influence of using δ13C measurements as additional constraints. In the tropics we find that the low level of constraints imposed by the atmospheric network limits the analysis of fluxes to zonal means. Finally, we calculate overall estimates of CO2 net sources and sinks at continental scale, accounting for all sensivity tests. Concerning the controversial partition of CO2 sink at mid and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, we find (on average, for the 1985–1995 period) an overall partition of the sink of 0.7±0.7 Gt C yr1 for North America, 0.2±0.3 Gt C yr−1 for the North Pacific Ocean, 0.5±0.8 Gt C yr−1 for Europe, 0.7±0.3 Gt C yr−1 for the North Atlantic Ocean, and 1.2±0.8 Gt C yr−1 for north Asia. This overall partition tends to place an important land uptake over north Asia. However, uncertainties remain large when we account for all the sensitivity tests.},

A box model analysis shows that future global biogeochemical cycling under projected technological provisions would result mainly in avoided increases and that estimated differences in atmospheric concentrations resulting from policies would be on the order of 1\% to 2\% per year.

Evaluating the effectiveness of the Convention (as required by Article 22) is a crucial component to ensure that it meets this objective.

The use of existing biotic Hg data will deﬁne spatial gradients (e.g., biological mercury hotspots), baselines to develop relevant temporal trends, and an ability to assess risk to taxa and human communities of greatest concern. We also recommend the development of a technical document that describes monitoring options for the Conference of Parties, to provide science-based standardized guidelines for collecting relevant monitoring information, as guided by Article 19.},

	abstract = {Abstract. High-quality atmospheric mercury (Hg) data are rare for South America,
especially for its tropical region. As a consequence, mercury dynamics are still
highly uncertain in this region. This is a significant deficiency, as South America
appears to play a major role in the global budget of this toxic pollutant.
To address this issue, we performed nearly 2 years (July 2014–February 2016) of continuous high-resolution total gaseous mercury (TGM) measurements
at the Chacaltaya (CHC) mountain site in the Bolivian Andes, which is
subject to a diverse mix of air masses coming predominantly from the
Altiplano and the Amazon rainforest. For the first 11 months of
measurements, we obtained a mean TGM concentration of 0.89±0.01 ng m−3, which is in good agreement with the sparse amount of data available from
the continent. For the remaining 9 months, we obtained a significantly
higher TGM concentration of 1.34±0.01 ng m−3, a difference which
we tentatively attribute to the strong El Niño event of 2015–2016.
Based on HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) back trajectories and clustering techniques, we show that
lower mean TGM concentrations were linked to either westerly Altiplanic air
masses or those originating from the lowlands to the southeast of CHC.
Elevated TGM concentrations were related to northerly air masses of
Amazonian or southerly air masses of Altiplanic origin, with the former possibly
linked to artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM), whereas the latter
might be explained by volcanic activity. We observed a marked seasonal
pattern, with low TGM concentrations in the dry season (austral winter),
rising concentrations during the biomass burning (BB) season, and the highest
concentrations at the beginning of the wet season (austral summer). With the
help of simultaneously sampled equivalent black carbon (eBC) and carbon
monoxide (CO) data, we use the clearly BB-influenced signal during the BB season
(August to October) to derive a mean TGM / CO emission ratio of (2.3±0.6)×10-7 ppbvTGM ppbvCO-1, which could be used to
constrain South American BB emissions. Through the link with CO2 measured in situ and remotely sensed solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) as
proxies for vegetation activity, we detect signs of a vegetation sink effect
in Amazonian air masses and derive a “best guess” TGM / CO2 uptake ratio of 0.058 ±0.017 (ng m−3)TGM ppmCO2-1. Finally, significantly
higher Hg concentrations in western Altiplanic air masses during the wet
season compared with the dry season point towards the modulation of
atmospheric Hg by the eastern Pacific Ocean.},

              A global surge in ‘artisanal’, smallscale mining (ASM) threatens biodiverse tropical forests and exposes residents to dangerous levels of mercury. In response, governments and development agencies are investing millions (USD) on ASM
              formalization
              ; registering concessions and demarcating extraction zones to promote regulatory adherence and direct mining away from ecologically sensitive areas. The environmental outcomes of these initiatives are seldom systematically assessed. We examine patterns of mining-related deforestation associated with formalization efforts in a gold-rich region of the Peruvian Amazon. We track changes from 2001 to 2014 when agencies: (a) issued 1701 provisional titles and (b) tried to restrict mining to a {\textgreater}5000 km
              2
              ‘corridor’. We use fixed-effect regression models and matching methods to control for gold price, geology, and accessibility. Mining increased dramatically during this period, clearing ∼40 000 ha of forest. After the mining corridor was declared and enforcement increased, new mining sites were opened more frequently within titled areas and inside the corridor than elsewhere. However, mining also increased in protected area buffer zones and native communities, and the proportion of mining area occurring outside the corridor grew, concentrated in a few hotspots. Interviews (
              n
              = 47) revealed that the hoped-for regulatory adherence failed to materialize because miners who were issued provisional titles started operations without complying with attendant environmental rules. Overlapping land claims for agriculture and forest extraction proved a major obstacle for obtaining full legal rights to mine. Miners resented the slow, costly formalization process but many sought titles to bolster territorial claims, avoid policing, obtain credit and recruit paying ‘guest’ miners who generally ignored regulations. We find that responses to formalization varied with changing context and while formalization may curb mining in some circumstances, it may exacerbate it in others. Without adequate enforcement, interagency coordination, and attention to competing land claims, formalizing ASM may accelerate ecological destruction.},

	abstract = {Ratification of the Minamata Convention on Mercury has led to the establishment of Peruvian regulations limiting mercury concentrations in air to 2000 ng/m3over a 24-hr measurement period. As a result, three communities in Madre de Dios, Peru were mapped during October 2017 to determine Hg0 vapor concentrations in the air. The town of Tres Islas exhibited Hg0 concentrations less than 200 ng/m3: the minimum risk level defined by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. These low concentrations were reflective of a town in the region with limited exposure to artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM). However, the ASGM communities of Laberinto and Delta One exhibited concentrations of Hg0 vapor that exceeded 2,000,000 ng/m3 surrounding active gold shops, where amalgams and processed amalgams were heated with open flames. Laberinto was reevaluated in May 2018 during which time Hg0 levels on the sidewalks in front of gold shops again exceeded 2,000,000 ng/m3. Within the scope of this paper a rapid mapping technique allows for the detection of sources of Hg0 pollution and identifies neighborhoods that require intervention to decrease Hg0 emissions. In addition, this work highlights the difficulties of measuring total gaseous mercury in ASGM communities with gold shops according to the Peruvian law.},

            Mercury is a globally transported pollutant with potent neurotoxic effects for both humans and wildlife. This study introduces an assessment method to estimate the potential human health-related economic benefits of global and domestic mercury control policies. It finds that for the US population as a whole, global mercury controls could lead to approximately twice the benefits of domestic action by 2050. This result is robust to several uncertainties and variabilities along the emissions-to-impacts path, although we find that those consuming locally caught freshwater fish in the United States could benefit more from domestic action.
          , 
            Mercury pollution poses risks for both human and ecosystem health. As a consequence, controlling mercury pollution has become a policy goal on both global and national scales. We developed an assessment method linking global-scale atmospheric chemical transport modeling to regional-scale economic modeling to consistently evaluate the potential benefits to the United States of global (UN Minamata Convention on Mercury) and domestic [Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS)] policies, framed as economic gains from avoiding mercury-related adverse health endpoints. This method attempts to trace the policies-to-impacts path while taking into account uncertainties and knowledge gaps with policy-appropriate bounding assumptions. We project that cumulative lifetime benefits from the Minamata Convention for individuals affected by 2050 are \$339 billion (2005 USD), with a range from \$1.4 billion to \$575 billion in our sensitivity scenarios. Cumulative economy-wide benefits to the United States, realized by 2050, are \$104 billion, with a range from \$6 million to \$171 billion. Projected Minamata benefits are more than twice those projected from the domestic policy. This relative benefit is robust to several uncertainties and variabilities, with the ratio of benefits (Minamata/MATS) ranging from ≈1.4 to 3. However, we find that for those consuming locally caught freshwater fish from the United States, rather than marine and estuarine fish from the global market, benefits are larger from US than global action, suggesting domestic policies are important for protecting these populations. Per megagram of prevented emissions, our domestic policy scenario results in US benefits about an order of magnitude higher than from our global scenario, further highlighting the importance of domestic action.},

	abstract = {Speciated mercury gridded emissions inventories together with chemical transport models and concentration measurements are essential when investigating both the effectiveness of mitigation measures and the mercury cycle in the environment. Since different mercury species have contrasting behaviour in the atmosphere, their proportion in anthropogenic emissions could determine the spatial impacts. In this study, the time series from 1970 to 2012 of the EDGARv4.tox2 global mercury emissions inventory are described; the total global mercury emission in 2010 is 1772 tonnes. Global grid-maps with geospatial distribution of mercury emissions at a 0.1° × 0.1° resolution are provided for each year. Compared to the previous tox1 version, tox2 provides updates for more recent years and improved emissions in particular for agricultural waste burning, power generation and artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) sectors. We have also developed three retrospective emissions scenarios based on different hypotheses related to the proportion of mercury species in the total mercury emissions for each activity sector; improvements in emissions speciation are seen when using information primarily from field measurements. We evaluated them using the GEOS-Chem 3-D mercury model in order to explore the influence of speciation shifts, to reactive mercury forms in particular, on regional wet deposition patterns. The reference scenario S1 (EDGARv4.tox2\_S1) uses speciation factors from the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP); scenario S2 (“EPA\_power”) uses factors from EPA's Information Collection Request (ICR); and scenario S3 (“Asia\_filedM”) factors from recent scientific publications. In the reference scenario, the sum of reactive mercury emissions (Hg-P and Hg2+) accounted for 25.3\% of the total global emissions; the regions/countries that have shares of reactive mercury emissions higher than 6\% in total global reactive mercury are China+ (30.9\%), India+ (12.5\%) and the United States (9.9\%). In 2010, the variations of reactive mercury emissions amongst the different scenarios are in the range of −19.3 t/yr (China+) to 4.4 t/yr (OECD\_Europe). However, at the sector level, the variation could be different, e.g., for the iron and steel industry in China reaches 15.4 t/yr. Model evaluation at the global level shows a variation of approximately ±10\% in wet deposition for the three emissions scenarios. An evaluation of the impact of mercury speciation within nested grid sensitivity simulations is performed for the United States and modelled wet deposition fluxes are compared with measurements. These studies show that using the S2 and S3 emissions of reactive mercury, can improve wet deposition estimates near sources.},

This paper reports findings from an environmental analysis undertaken directly within three small-scale gold mining sites in Ghana. Using targeted soil and water sampling analysed through mass spectrometry, the findings are compared with findings in the literature and safety guidelines to gauge the scale of contamination at surveyed sites. The analysis reveals that there is widespread pollution, often several orders higher than background levels.

Miners can choose between Chilean-mill processing centers, where the ore is ground, concentrated and amalgamated, or “Chancha” Centers, where the whole ore is amalgamated. By weighing mercury before and after all unit operations involved in the amalgamation process, it was possible to determine mercury losses. Analyses in eight centers indicated that 51–59\% of mercury introduced into the amalgamation process is recovered when miners squeeze the excess mercury. Around 29\% of total mercury is lost when miners burn amalgam and gold is melted, and 15\% is lost with the tailings. When only gravity concentrates are amalgamated, 1.4\% of mercury entering the process is lost with tailings, whereas 29.5\% is lost when the whole ore is amalgamated. Approximately 1.5 tonnes/annum of mercury is released in Portovelo-Zaruma, from which 70\% is evaporated and 30\% is released with tailings. Mercury-contaminated tailings are leached with cyanide in agitated tanks. A large majority of the processing centers dispose the final tailings with mercury and cyanide into the Calera River and Amarillo River. Mercury dissolved with cyanide likely becomes more bioavailable than metallic mercury. A campaign for reducing mercury emissions must focus on the use of individual retorts – mercury pollution control devices – and the elimination of whole ore amalgamation.},

In this effort, Hg losses in ASGM were derived from the difference between estimates of total Au production and the production reported by conventional gold mining. On the basis of this result, the average ratio of Hg lost to Au produced in ASGM was estimated to be 1.96 in Africa, 4.63 in Latin America, and 1.23 in Asia. The difference among regions can be attributed to the amalgamation procedure used by the miners, in which whole-ore amalgamation is predominant in Latin America and Asia. The obtained estimated ratio of Hglost:Auproduced suggested the possibility to detect either Au or Hg smuggling from one country to another. On the other hand, the importance of considering cyanidation in ASGM was also suggested.},

	abstract = {Probability distribution functions (PDFs) of model inputs that aﬀect the transport and dispersion of a trace gas released from a coastal California nuclear power plant are quantiﬁed using ensemble simulations, machine learning algorithms, and Bayesian inversion. The PDFs are constrained by observations of tracer concentrations and account for uncertainty in meteorology, transport, diﬀusion, and emissions. Meteorological uncertainty is calculated using an ensemble of simulations of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model that samples ﬁve categories of model inputs (initialization time, boundary layer physics, land surface model, nudging options, and reanalysis data). The WRF output is used to drive tens of thousands of FLEXPART dispersion simulations that sample a uniform distribution of six emissions inputs. Machine learning algorithms are trained on the ensemble data, and used to quantify the sources of ensemble variability and to infer, via inverse modeling, the values of the 11 model inputs most consistent with tracer measurements. We ﬁnd a substantial ensemble spread in tracer concentrations (factors of 10 to 103), most of which is due to changing emissions inputs (about 80\%), though the cumulative eﬀects of meteorological variations are not negligible. The performance of the inverse method is veriﬁed using synthetic observations generated from arbitrarily selected simulations. When applied to measurements from a controlled tracer release experiment, the inverse method satisfactorily determines the location, start time, duration and amount. In a 2 km × 2 km area of possible locations, the actual location is determined to within 200 meters. The start time is determined to within 5 minutes out of 2 hours, and the duration to within 50 minutes out of 4 hours. Over a range of release amounts of 10 kg to 1000 kg, the estimated amount exceeds the actual amount of 146 kg by only 32 kg. The inversion also estimates probabilities of diﬀerent WRF conﬁgurations.

	abstract = {This paper explains how formalizing and supporting artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) – low-tech, laborintensive mineral processing and extraction – would help governments in sub-Saharan Africa meet several targets linked the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While most of the men and women found working in ASM in the region choose to operate without the requisite permits and are rarely monitored or regulated, the local impacts of their activities are significant. After examining the long historical trajectory that has relegated most ASM activities in sub-Saharan Africa to the informal economy, three of the sector’s more obvious economic impacts are reviewed: its contribution to regional mineral outputs; how operations create employment opportunities for millions of people directly, and millions more in the downstream and upstream industries they spawn; and the links the sector has with subsistence agriculture, dynamics which have important implications for food security and gender equality. These contributions alone are sufficient justification for featuring ASM more prominently in the plans, policies and programs being launched in sub-Saharan Africa to help host governments meet their commitments to the SDGs.},
