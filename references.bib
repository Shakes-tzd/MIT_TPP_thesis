	abstract = {Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is a significant contributor of mercury (Hg) contamination and deforestation across the globe. In the Colorado River watershed in Madre de Dios, Peru, mining and deforestation have increased exponentially since the 1980s, resulting in major socioeconomic shifts in the region and two national state of emergency (2016 and 2019) in response to concerns for wide-scale mercury poisoning by these activities. This research employed a watershed-scale soil particle detachment model and environmental field sampling to estimate the role of land cover change and soil erosion on river transport of Hg in a heavily ASGM-impacted watershed. The model estimated that observed decreases in forest cover increased soil mobilization by a factor of two in the Colorado River watershed during the 18 year period and by 4-fold in the Puquiri subwatershed (the area of most concentrated ASGM activity). If deforestation continues to increase at its current exponential rate through 2030, the annual mobilization of soil and Hg may increase by an additional 20–25\% relative to 2014 levels. While, the estimated total mass of Hg transported by rivers is substantially less than the estimated tons of Hg used with ASGM in Peru, this research shows that deforestation associated with ASGM is an additional mechanism for mobilizing naturally occurring and anthropogenic Hg from terrestrial landscapes to aquatic environments in the region, potentially leading to bioaccumulation in fish and exposure to communities downstream.},

	abstract = {Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is a major contributor to deforestation and the largest anthropogenic source of atmospheric mercury worldwide. Despite significant information on the direct health impacts of mercury to ASGM miners, the impact of mercury contamination on downstream communities has not been well characterized, particularly in Peru's Madre de Dios region. In this area, ASGM has increased significantly since 2000 and has led to substantial political and social controversy. This research examined the spatial distribution and transport of mercury through the Madre de Dios River with distance from ASGM activity. This study also characterized risks for dietary mercury exposure to local residents who depend on fish from the river. River sediment, suspended solids from the water column, and fish samples were collected in 2013 at 62 sites near 17 communities over a 560 km stretch of the Madre de Dios River and its major tributaries. In areas downstream of known ASGM activity, mercury concentrations in sediment, suspended solids, and fish within the Madre de Dios River were elevated relative to locations upstream of mining. Fish tissue mercury concentrations were observed at levels representing a public health threat, with greater than one-third of carnivorous fish exceeding the international health standard of 0.5 mg kg(-1). This study demonstrates that communities located hundreds of kilometers downstream of ASGM activity, including children and indigenous populations who may not be involved in mining, are at risk of dietary mercury exposure that exceed acceptable body burdens. This report represents the first systematic study of the region to aid policy decision-making related to ASGM activities in Peru.},

	abstract = {Mercury (Hg) is used by small-scale gold miners in more than 50 developing countries, where the accompanied releases affect human health and the environment. The objectives of this paper are to summarize present use of Hg in artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) worldwide, reveal the origin of part of the Hg used by the gold miners, and propose appropriate actions to reduce the resulting Hg emissions. Significant releases of mercury are associated with inefficient amalgamation techniques. Releases are estimated to range from 800 to 1000tonne/annum. Of this total, approximately 200–250tonne of Hg are released in China, 100–150tonne in Indonesia, and 10–30tonne each in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Philippines, Venezuela and Zimbabwe. Mercury usually enters these countries legally – typically imported from countries in the European Union – although in some cases and in some years (e.g., Indonesia, Venezuela, etc.), the reported imports of Hg are far below estimated consumption. Meanwhile, the EU, while gradually replacing Hg products and processes with more environmentally benign alternatives, paradoxically continues to produce virgin Hg at government-owned mines, further exacerbating a general global oversupply of Hg – evident from its historically low market price. Political leadership is needed to avoid the transfer of excess Hg, and related health and environmental risks from the EU to third countries. Otherwise, the present situation will continue or even worsen, with no oversight or control of the global Hg trade in which the transfer of excess EU Hg to artisanal miners is favoured by low Hg prices relative to gold prices.},

	abstract = {Many factors such as poverty, ineffective institutions and environmental regulations may prevent developing countries from managing how natural resources are extracted to meet a strong market demand. Extraction for some resources has reached such proportions that evidence is measurable from space. We present recent evidence of the global demand for a single commodity and the ecosystem destruction resulting from commodity extraction, recorded by satellites for one of the most biodiverse areas of the world. We find that since 2003, recent mining deforestation in Madre de Dios, Peru is increasing nonlinearly alongside a constant annual rate of increase in international gold price (∼18\%/yr). We detect that the new pattern of mining deforestation (1915 ha/year, 2006–2009) is outpacing that of nearby settlement deforestation. We show that gold price is linked with exponential increases in Peruvian national mercury imports over time (R2 = 0.93, p = 0.04, 2003–2009). Given the past rates of increase we predict that mercury imports may more than double for 2011 (∼500 t/year). Virtually all of Peru's mercury imports are used in artisanal gold mining. Much of the mining increase is unregulated/artisanal in nature, lacking environmental impact analysis or miner education. As a result, large quantities of mercury are being released into the atmosphere, sediments and waterways. Other developing countries endowed with gold deposits are likely experiencing similar environmental destruction in response to recent record high gold prices. The increasing availability of satellite imagery ought to evoke further studies linking economic variables with land use and cover changes on the ground.},

The objective of this Convention is to protect human health and the environment by controlling the releases of POPs. According to its Article 16, the effectiveness of the Stockholm Convention shall be evaluated using comparable monitoring data on the presence of POPs as well as their regional and global environmental transport. Here, we present a time series analysis on atmospheric POP concentrations from 15 monitoring stations in North America and Europe that provide long-term data and have started operations between 1990 and 2003. We systematically searched for temporal trends and significant structural changes in temporal trends that might result from the provisions of the Stockholm Convention. We find that such structural changes do occur, but they are related mostly to effects of national regulations enforced prior to the implementation of the Stockholm Convention, rather than to the enforcement of the provisions laid out in the Convention. One example is that concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls, many of which started to decrease rapidly during the 1990s. Also effects of chemical transport and fate, for instance the re-volatilization of POPs from secondary sources, are thought to be a cause of some of the observed structural changes. We conclude that a decade of air monitoring data has not been sufficient for detecting general and statistically significant effects of the Stockholm Convention. Based on these lessons, we present recommendations for the future operation of existing monitoring programs and advocate for a stricter enforcement of the provisions of the Stockholm Convention, in the current absence of proof for its effectiveness.},

This paper is a contribution to the ongoing effectiveness evaluation (EE) work aimed at the assessment and enhancement of the effectiveness of the actions undertaken under the SC. First we consider some aspects related to the monitoring of POPs in the environment and then briefly review modeling frameworks that have been used to simulate long range transport (LRT) of POPs. In the final sections we describe the institutional arrangements providing the conditions for this work to unfold now and some suggestions for it in the future. A more effective use of existing monitoring data could be made if scientists who deposited them in publicly available and supervised sites were rewarded in academic and professional terms. We also suggest the development of multi-media, nested, Lagrangian models to improve the understanding of changes over time in the environment and individual organisms.},

	abstract = {The recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer relies on the continued decline in the atmospheric concentrations of ozone-depleting gases such as chlorofluorocarbons1. The atmospheric concentration of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11), the second-most abundant chlorofluorocarbon, has declined substantially since the mid-1990s2. A recently reported slowdown in the decline of the atmospheric concentration of CFC-11 after 2012, however, suggests that global emissions have increased3,4. A concurrent increase in CFC-11 emissions from eastern Asia contributes to the global emission increase, but the location and magnitude of this regional source are unknown3. Here, using high-frequency atmospheric observations from Gosan, South Korea, and Hateruma, Japan, together with global monitoring data and atmospheric chemical transport model simulations, we investigate regional CFC-11 emissions from eastern Asia. We show that emissions from eastern mainland China are 7.0 ± 3.0 (±1 standard deviation) gigagrams per year higher in 2014–2017 than in 2008–2012, and that the increase in emissions arises primarily around the northeastern provinces of Shandong and Hebei. This increase accounts for a substantial fraction (at least 40 to 60 per cent) of the global rise in CFC-11 emissions. We find no evidence for a significant increase in CFC-11 emissions from any other eastern Asian countries or other regions of the world where there are available data for the detection of regional emissions. The attribution of any remaining fraction of the global CFC-11 emission rise to other regions is limited by the sparsity of long-term measurements of sufficient frequency near potentially emissive regions. Several considerations suggest that the increase in CFC-11 emissions from eastern mainland China is likely to be the result of new production and use, which is inconsistent with the Montreal Protocol agreement to phase out global chlorofluorocarbon production by 2010.},

	abstract = {The Montreal Protocol was designed to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by enabling reductions in the abundance of ozone-depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the atmosphere1–3. The reduction in the atmospheric concentration of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) has made the second-largest contribution to the decline in the total atmospheric concentration of ozone-depleting chlorine since the 1990s1. However, CFC-11 still contributes one-quarter of all chlorine reaching the stratosphere, and a timely recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer depends on a sustained decline in CFC-11 concentrations1. Here we show that the rate of decline of atmospheric CFC-11 concentrations observed at remote measurement sites was constant from 2002 to 2012, and then slowed by about 50 per cent after 2012. The observed slowdown in the decline of CFC-11 concentration was concurrent with a 50 per cent increase in the mean concentration difference observed between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and also with the emergence of strong correlations at the Mauna Loa Observatory between concentrations of CFC-11 and other chemicals associated with anthropogenic emissions. A simple model analysis of our findings suggests an increase in CFC-11 emissions of 13 ± 5 gigagrams per year (25 ± 13 per cent) since 2012, despite reported production being close to zero4 since 2006. Our three-dimensional model simulations confirm the increase in CFC-11 emissions, but indicate that this increase may have been as much as 50 per cent smaller as a result of changes in stratospheric processes or dynamics. The increase in emission of CFC-11 appears unrelated to past production; this suggests unreported new production, which is inconsistent with the Montreal Protocol agreement to phase out global CFC production by 2010.},

	title = {Masseteric-facial nerve transposition for reanimation of the smile in incomplete facial paralysis},
	abstract = {Incomplete facial paralysis occurs in about a third of patients with Bell's palsy. Although their faces are symmetrical at rest, when they smile they have varying degrees of disfigurement. Currently, cross-face nerve grafting is one of the most useful techniques for reanimation. Transfer of the masseteric nerve, although widely used for complete paralysis, has not to our knowledge been reported for incomplete palsy. Between December 2008 and November 2013, we reanimated the faces of 9 patients (2 men and 7 women) with incomplete unilateral facial paralysis with transposition of the masseteric nerve. Sex, age at operation, cause of paralysis, duration of denervation, recipient nerves used, and duration of follow-up were recorded. Commissural excursion, velocity, and patients' satisfaction were evaluated with the FACIAL CLIMA and a questionnaire, respectively. The mean (SD) age at operation was 39 (¬¨¬®¬¨¬±6) years and the duration of denervation was 29 (¬¨¬®¬¨¬±19) months. There were no complications that required further intervention. Duration of follow-up ranged from 6-26 months. FACIAL CLIMA showed improvement in both commissural excursion and velocity of more than two thirds in 6 patients, more than one half in 2 patients and less than one half in one. Qualitative evaluation showed a slight or pronounced improvement in 7/9 patients. The masseteric nerve is a reliable alternative for reanimation of the smile in patients with incomplete facial paralysis. Its main advantages include its consistent anatomy, a one-stage operation, and low morbidity at the donor site.},

	title = {Hemihypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy after mastoid dissection of the facial nerve: results in 24 patients and comparison with the classic technique},
	abstract = {Objective: Hypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy has been widely used for reanimation of paralyzed facial muscles after irreversible proximal injury of the facial nerve. However, complete section of the hypoglossal nerve occasionally results in hemiglossal dysfunction and interferes with swallowing and speech. To reduce this morbidity, a modified technique with partial section of the hypoglossal nerve after mastoid dissection of the facial nerve (HFM) has been used. We report our experience with the HFM technique, retrospectively comparing the outcome with results of the classic hypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy. Methods: A retrospective review was performed in 36 patients who underwent hypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy with the classic (n = 12) or variant technique (n = 24) between 2000 and 2006. Facial outcome was evaluated with the House-Brackmann grading system, and tongue function was evaluated with a new scale proposed to quantify postoperative tongue alteration. The results were compared, and age and time between nerve injury and surgery were correlated with the outcome. Results: There was no significant difference between the two techniques concerning facial reanimation. A worse outcome of tongue function, however, was associated with the classic technique (Mann-Whitney U test; P {\textless} 0.05). When HFM was used, significant correlations defined by the Spearman test were identified between preoperative delay (rho = 0.59; P = 0.002) or age (rho = 0.42; P = 0.031) and results of facial reanimation evaluated with the House-Brackmann grading system. Conclusion: HFM is as effective as classic hypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy for facial reanimation, and it has a much lower morbidity related to tongue function. Better results are obtained in younger patients and with a shorter interval between facial nerve injury and surgery.},

	title = {[{Successful} reanimation of facial paralysis with an indirect anastomosis between hypoglossal nerve and facial nerve, without loss of function of the tongue]},
	abstract = {Objective: To describe the surgical procedure and the results of the indirect hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis using a free nerve graft in patients with facial nerve paralysis. This technique leaves the tongue function intact. Design: Prospective study. Methods: Tongue function was assessed in 39 consecutive patients who underwent this procedure and facial reanimation was assessed in 29 of these patients who had completed at least 24 months follow-up. Facial nerve function was judged using the House-Brackmann (HB) facial nerve grading system. Results: Tongue movements were normal in all operated patients; one patient had mild homolateral atrophy. Initial facial movements occurred on average 7.5 months postoperatively (range 4 to 18 months) in all but one patient. The results were graded HB II in 6 patients (20.9\%), HB III in 13 (44.6\%), HB IV in 7 (24.1\%), HB V in 2 (6.8\%) and HB VI in 1 patient (3.4\%). Hemifacial synkineses were noticeable but no mass movements or gross hypertonia were observed (as are often present in direct hypoglossal-facial anastomosis). The results of facial reanimation were significantly better in young patients and when a short time interval between paralysis and surgery existed. HB grade II was achieved only if the duration of paralysis was less than 12 months. Conclusion: Indirect hypoglossal-facial anastomosis with interposition of a nerve graft allows preservation of tongue function together with good overall facial reanimation, and is therefore to be preferred to the classical direct hypoglossal-facial anastomosis.},

	abstract = {Objectives/hypothesis: To describe a modified facial nerve reconstruction technique for complex defects of the facial fan after parotid surgery that avoids synkinesis between upper and lower face. Study design: Retrospective case series. Methods: Patients who had undergone radical parotidectomy with a large defect of the facial fan, reconstruction of the upper face by facial nerve interpositional graft, and reconstruction of the lower face by hypoglossal-facial nerve jump nerve suture were included in this series. Results: Four patients underwent the modified combined approach after tumor resection and prior to postoperative radiotherapy in three of the four cases. Surgery was combined with an upper lid weight implantation. Regeneration of the face was successful in all cases within 12 to 16 months. Most important, the separated reanimation of the upper and lower face circumvented synkinesis of the upper and lower face. This factor was essential for good functional results. Using the hypoglossal jump technique instead of a classical cross-nerve suture technique prevented the sacrifice of ipsilateral tongue function. Conclusions: The presented method offers satisfactory results for facial reanimation and avoids synkinesis between the upper and lower face. Using the jump technique instead of a classic hypoglossal transfer as it was described originally for the combined approach avoids long-term sequelae for the tongue.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Smile reanimation should be considered from a dynamic perspective. Any intervention should restore normality. To date no such normative dynamic data has been published. Aim: To quantitatively analyse maximal smiles between a healthy group of Caucasian male and female adults using 3D motion capture (4D stereophotogrammetry). Method: Using a 3D facial motion capture system 54 males and 54 female volunteers were imaged whilst performing a maximal smile. Eight nasolabial landmarks were digitised and tracked. Differences in displacement and speed of bilateral landmarks between males and females were analysed in each direction (x, y, z and Euclidian), from rest (T0), to median smile (T1) and maximal smile (T2), using paired t-tests and Wilcoxon-Signed Rank tests. Results: In males and females the displacement and speed of the left and right alar base landmarks were similar in the x and y directions but less in the z direction. For the philtrum, the displacement and speed of the bilateral landmarks were similar in the y and z directions, but less in the x direction. The left alar base and left philtrum moved significantly more in males. Left and right cheilion moved a similar amount in the x and y directions but more in the z direction. Labiale superius moved significantly more in the z direction, and labiale inferius moved significantly more in the y direction in males. In conclusion, this study has presented a novel normative data set of dynamic nasolabial complex movement for males and females during maximum smile. The data, as well as providing magnitudes of displacements of the nasolabial complex, also provides the speeds of movement.},

	abstract = {Ninety-two children, the entire series of paediatric facial reanimation by a single surgeon over thirty years, are presented. The objective is to analyse the incidence and value of secondary revisions for functional and aesthetic refinements following the two main stages of reanimation. The reconstructive strategy varied according to the denervation time, the aetiology, and whether the paralysis was uni- or bilateral, complete or partial. Irrespective of these variables, 89\% of the patients required secondary surgery. Post-operative videos were available in seventy-two cases. Four independent observers graded patients' videos using a scale from poor to excellent. The effect of diverse secondary procedures was measured computing a mean-percent-gain score. Statistical differences between treatment groups means were tested by the t-test and one-way ANOVA. Two-thirds of the corrective and ancillary techniques utilized granted significantly higher mean-scores post-secondary surgery. A comparison of pre- and post-operative data found valuable improvements in all three facial zones after secondary surgery. In conclusion, inherent to dynamic procedures is the need for secondary revisions. Secondary surgery builds in the potential of reanimation surgery, effectively augmenting functional faculties and aesthesis.},

	abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study was to introduce the use of selective ipsilateral C7 spinal nerve transfer to the armamentarium of the dynamic procedures used for facial reanimation in Moebius patients. Methods: Between 1991 and 2007, the selective ipsilateral C7 technique was used in four patients. In three patients with bilateral paralysis, both C7 spinal nerves were utilized as nerve donors. Thus, evaluation of outcomes was carried out in seven hemifaces. Results: Short-term paresthesia on the index pulp of the donor upper extremity was observed in four limbs, which recovered spontaneously. Motor deficits were never noticed. Neurotization of the free-muscle transfer for smile was performed in five hemifaces, with good results in three hemifaces (p {\textless} 0.01, z = 2.61). Eye closure neurotization was made in six hemifaces, with good results in four hemifaces (p {\textless} 0.01, z = 2.88). Depressor neurotization was made in one case and resulted in improved depressor complex function. In two cases of free muscle transfer for masseter substitution, electromyographic interpretations revealed full motor activity after bilateral latissimus dorsi transfer. Tongue neurotization was performed in two instances. Postoperatively, the patients' speech intelligibility improved as well as tongue motility and bulk. Conclusion: The use of the C7 as a motor donor in Moebius cases with multicranial nerve involvement supplies the typical mask-like face with an abundance of motor fibers for facial reanimation and, if there is a coexisting twelfth nerve palsy, for speech restoration.},

	abstract = {Background: Facial synkinesia is a common sequela of facial palsy, affecting 15 to 20 percent of patients. The rate of postoperative synkinesia after facial reanimation is not clearly established. The severity and type of synkinesia determine the degree of clinical relevance. Methods: One hundred sixty-seven patients with facial palsy were included in this retrospective cohort study. Three-dimensional video analysis of facial movements was performed preoperatively and 18 months after facial reanimation. The severity of synkinesia was rated subjectively on a four-degree severity scale. Objective three-dimensional analysis of synkinesia was performed on patients with 18-month follow-up times. Results: Preoperatively, 84.4 percent of patients were not affected by synkinesia, 9 percent presented with mild synkinesia, 4.2 percent presented with moderate synkinesia, and 2.4 percent presented with severe synkinesia. Postoperatively, 51 percent of all patients presented with facial synkinesia (41.8 percent mild, 17.3 percent moderate, and 1 percent severe synkinesia; some patients had more than one type). Patients treated with territorially differentiated gracilis muscle transplantation were most frequently affected (69.8 percent), followed by patients treated with gracilis muscle transplantation in combination with temporalis muscle transposition to the eye (51.8 percent). Oculo-oral synkinesia was the most frequent form of synkinesia. Conclusions: After surgical reanimation of the paralyzed face, half of the patients presented with synkinesia. The majority of patients developed mild or moderate forms of synkinesia; therefore, the clinical relevance of synkinesia has to be seen in the context of total facial function. Because of the high prevalence of synkinesia, it should be documented and addressed in patients undergoing facial reanimation. Clinical question/level of evidence: Therapeutic, IV.},

	abstract = {Facial paralysis has profound effects on the functional and psychosocial well-being of patients. Various surgical facial reanimation techniques have been described to address this devastating condition. While traditional surgical approaches have proved successful in restoring either facial tone or facial movement, newer combination nerve transfer techniques are addressing the limitations of the traditional single nerve transfer approaches. Methods: This study aimed to describe a promising new surgical approach to facial reanimation utilizing a dual nerve transfer to maximize both resting and active symmetry while minimizing postoperative synkinesis. Here, we use the masseteric nerve to selectively innervate the miDFace in combination with a hypoglossal facial nerve graft to reanimate the remaining facial regions. Results: To date, we have performed this operation on four patients, all of whom tolerated the procedure well. Our patients are showing significant improvements in both resting facial tone and facial movement with no signs of synkinesis at 9 months postoperative. Conclusions: We believe this dual nerve transfer to be superior in restoring the combination of tone, symmetry, and movement to the paralyzed face when compared with traditional single nerve transfer approaches.},

	abstract = {Background: Evaluation of the severity of facial paralysis deformity and the effectiveness of reconstructive surgery requires a measurement tool that is practical and simple enough for daily use. It should be able to objectively measure facial asymmetry at rest and the amount of facial movement during expression. The authors present and assess a simple measurement technique that is readily usable in the clinic. Designed to evaluate smile reconstruction, the technique can be used to evaluate other parts of the paralyzed face, such as the eye, nose, and forehead. Methods: A standardized handheld ruler measuring technique is described for the assessment of the position and the movement of five points marked on the lips. The measured points are used to characterize the position of the mouth at rest and the movement that occurs with smiling. The technique uses two transparent rulers that are held in the examiner's hand. Using this technique, two experienced examiners separately measured the rest position of 21 unilateral facial paralysis patients twice, creating 84 sets of measurements. Accuracy was assessed by simultaneously measuring the movement of the commissure and mid upper lip during smiling on 10 normal persons using both handheld ruler and a proven technique, the facial reanimation measurement system. Results: The average intraclass correlation coefficients for interrater and intrarater reliability exceed 0.89. The mean difference between the handheld ruler and facial reanimation measurement system measurements was 1.7 mm. Conclusion: The handheld ruler technique is simple, reliable, and accurate, providing useful measurements for the evaluation of facial paralysis reconstructions.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Masticatory muscles or their nerve supply are options for facial reanimation surgery, but their ability to create spontaneous smile has been questioned. This study assessed the percentage of healthy adults who activate the temporalis and masseter muscles during voluntary and spontaneous smile. Methods: Healthy volunteer adults underwent electromyography (EMG) studies of the temporalis and masseter muscles during voluntary and spontaneous smile. Responses were repeated three times and recorded as negative, weakly positive, or strongly positive according to the activity observed. The best response was used for analysis. Results: Thirty healthy adults (median age: 34 years, range: 25-69 years) participated. Overall, 92\% of the masseter muscles were activated during voluntary smile (22\% strong, 70\% weak). Seventy-seven percent of the masseter muscles were activated in spontaneous smile (12\% strong, 65\% weak). The temporalis muscle was activated in 62\% of responses in voluntary smile (15\% strong, 47\% weak) and in 45\% of responses in spontaneous smile (13\% strong, 32\% weak). No significant difference was found for males vs females or closed vs open mouth smiles. There was no significant difference in responses between voluntary and spontaneous smiles for the temporalis and masseter muscles, and their use in voluntary smile did not predict activity in spontaneous smile. Conclusions: Our study has shown that masseter and temporalis are active in a high proportion of healthy adults during voluntary and spontaneous smiles. Further work is required to determine the relationship between preoperative donor muscle activation and postoperative spontaneous smile, and whether masticatory muscle activity can be upregulated with appropriate training.},

	title = {[{Comparison} of cross face nerve graft with masseteric nerve as donor nerves for free functional muscle transfers in facial reanimation surgery]},
	abstract = {Several surgical techniques have been proposed for the reconstruction of the smile in facial paralysis. The 2-stage approach utilising a cross-facial nerve graft (CFNG) and subsequent free functional muscle transfer represents the "gold standard". A single-stage alternative is the use of the masseteric nerve as donor nerve. Here we have retrospectively analysed the outcome of 8 patients who were treated with either of these procedures (4 per treatment group). We compared the oral commisure excursion between the 2 groups. Use of the masseteric nerve led to reinnervation of the muscle graft within 3 months. The 2-stage procedure required more than 12 months from the first procedure until first muscle contractions could be observed. A spontaneous smile could not be achieved in all patients when the masseteric nerve was used. The oral commisure excursion was symmetrical when compared to the healthy side in both groups, however the excursion was significantly higher in the masseteric nerve group compared to the CFNG group of patients. Most patients with the masseteric nerve as a donor nerve underwent a secondary procedure, which involved thinning of the muscle flap. In conclusion, the use of the masseteric nerve as a donor nerve for facial reanimation surgery is a single-stage alternative to the use of a CFNG as donor nerve. It delivers reliable results with strong muscle contractions with limitations in regard to achieving a spontaneous smile.},

	abstract = {Background: Free muscle transfer for facial reanimation has become the standard of care in recent decades and is now the cornerstone intervention for dynamic smile reanimation. We sought to quantify smile excursion and quality-of-life (QOL) changes in our pediatric free gracilis recipients following reanimation. Methods: We quantified gracilis muscle excursion in 17 pediatric patients undergoing 19 consecutive pediatric free gracilis transplantation operations, using our validated SMILE program, as an objective measure of functional outcome. These were compared against excursion measured the same way in a cohort of 17 adults with 19 free gracilis operations. In addition, we prospectively evaluated QOL outcomes in these children using the Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE) instrument. Results: The mean gracilis excursion in our pediatric free gracilis recipients was 8.8 mm ¬¨¬± 5.0 mm, which matched adult results, but with fewer complete failures of less than 2-mm excursion, with 2 (11\%) and 4 (21\%), respectively. Quality-of-life measures indicated statistically significant improvements following dynamic smile reanimation (P = .01). Conclusions: Dynamic facial reanimation using free gracilis transfer in children has an acceptable success rate, yields improved commissure excursion, and improves QOL in the pediatric population. It should be considered first-line therapy for children with lack of a meaningful smile secondary to facial paralysis.},

The results of this approach were hitherto unquantified. Methods: This study retrospectively assessed peer-reviewed, patient-rated and objective outcomes following staged reanimation in adults between 2010 and 2020. Demographics, palsy characteristics and surgery details were recorded. Pre- and postoperative videos were rated by independent assessors using Terzis' aesthetic and symmetry scale. Photographs were analysed using Emotrics and patients completed the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) patient-rated outcome measure. Results: Ten patients [mean age = 34 (SD = 12.48)] were eligible. All regained lip elevation and depression. All markers of symmetry improved after gracilis transfer. All markers were also improved after ABDMT except for lower lip height when smiling with teeth showing (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Five patients (50\%) responded to the GBI (mean score = +39.44).

Nine patients underwent aesthetic refinements [lipofilling to lower lip notches (n = 5), debulking of gracilis bulk (n = 6), repositioning of muscle insertion (n = 5) and facelifts (n = 2)]. Conclusion: The outcomes were positive objectively and as judged by peers and patients themselves. Aesthetic refinements may also be required to enhance these results.},

	abstract = {Aim: In patient with facial paralysis, facial appearance and muscular ability are impaired, and the psychological integrity is affected. Botulinum toxin A may be used to improve facial symmetry in patients suffering with facial palsy reducing the progressive contralateral hyperkinesis and facial asymmetry after primary surgery for facial paralysis. Material of study: Six patients, whom have been suffering unilateral facial palsy with an House-Brackmann score grade from III to VI, were included in this study for a residual facial asymmetry and contralateral hyperkinesis after previous facial reanimation. They were treated with 50 units of botulinum toxin type A injected in muscles of the unaffected side of face to improve muscular ability and facial symmetry. Results: This study demonstrated reduction in contralateral hyperkinesis and facial asymmetry that lasted approximately 120 days. All patients reported satisfactory results with the treatment. Comments: Botulinum toxin type A injections improved facial asymmetry and muscular function in all patients. Discussion and comments: Botulinum toxin type A injections may be an indispensable technique as a nonsurgical treatment or as a complementary measure in postsurgical treatments and should be certainly considered for temporary or permanent asymmetries in patients who suffer from facial palsy. Conclusions: Contralateral botulinum toxin type A injection was useful in reducing muscular hyperkinesis in patients with residual facial asymmetry after primary surgery for facial palsy, improving aesthetic and functional facial recovery with not widely common adverse events.},

	title = {Neurotization {Preferences} in {Smile} {Reanimation}: {A} {Discrete} {Choice} {Experiment}},
	abstract = {Background: Common donor nerve options in smile reanimation include ipsilateral trigeminal motor or contralateral facial nerve branches. Neurotization preference may be influenced by multiple factors, whose relative importance remains poorly understood. In this article, decision-making in smile reanimation is assessed using a stated preference model. Methods: Qualitative interviews with facial palsy patients identified five relevant attributes for study: smile type ("smile when biting" versus "smile spontaneously" as proxies for trigeminal versus cross-facial neurotization), number of operations, success rates, complication rates, and side effects. Community volunteers (n = 250) completed a discrete-choice experiment relevant to free muscle transfer for smile reanimation. Preoperative and postoperative states were demonstrated through video vignettes, together with explanation of surgical risks, consequences, and benefits. Attribute importance was modeled using hierarchical Bayes estimation. Results: Two hundred forty-one responses met quality controls. Attribute importance ranked as follows: chance of success, 37.3 percent; smile type, 21.4 percent; side effects, 13.9 percent; complication rates, 13.8; and number of operations, 13.6 percent. All attributes significantly correlated with decision making (p {\textless} 0.0001). An aggregate response model revealed most participants (67.6 percent; standard error, 3.0 percent) preferred smile reanimation by cross-facial (assuming a success rate of 80 percent) as opposed to ipsilateral trigeminal motor branch neurotization. When the success rate for cross-facial neurotization was reduced below 67 percent, trigeminal neurotization was preferred. Conclusions: Despite a higher risk of failure, most respondents preferred a cross-facial as opposed to trigeminal neurotization strategy for smile reanimation. These findings highlight the complexity of decision-making and need for individualized risk tolerance assessment in the field of facial reanimation.},

Method: This study included 14 patients who underwent hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis after schwannoma removal and were followed for more than 1 year. Three surgical techniques were performed: end-to-end, end-to-side, and split anastomoses. Facial palsy and tongue atrophy after anastomosis were evaluated using the scales suggested by House-Brackmann and Martins, respectively. Tumor volume and the time to surgery were also evaluated, and the effects on facial outcomes were analyzed.

An NLF reset technique that enhances miDFace lifts has been introduced to overcome this problem. Our study included 43 consecutive patients who underwent facial reanimation surgery with free functional muscle transfer between March 2015 and July 2017. Of these, 20 patients underwent conventional procedures and 23 underwent our NLF reset technique. Postoperative oral commissure excursion and symmetry at rest and while smiling were quantified using FACEgram (Facial Assessment by Computer Evaluation) software. To detect soft-tissue changes after surgery, three-dimensional analysis was performed using Morpheus¬¨√Ü, a 3D, LED-based, white-structured-light scanner. The NLF group had a significantly larger postoperative mean excursion at rest (control 25.32 ¬¨¬± 2.80 mm vs NLF 27.42 ¬¨¬± 3.60 mm; p = 0.047). The mean horizontal length ratios (affected-to-healthy) revealed better symmetry in the NLF group (resting 1.05 ¬¨¬± 0.22, smiling 0.97 ¬¨¬± 0.19; p = 0.201). The three-dimensional miDFace volume difference was significantly lower in the NLF group. The NLF reset technique produced improved surgical outcomes. An incision made along a mirrored NLF can influence miDFace lifting in patients with facial palsy, with the soft tissue concentrated in the lower face mobilized superomedially.},

	title = {Single-stage dynamic reanimation of the smile in irreversible facial paralysis by free functional muscle transfer},
	abstract = {Unilateral facial paralysis is a common disease that is associated with significant functional, aesthetic and psychological issues. Though idiopathic facial paralysis (Bell's palsy) is the most common diagnosis, patients can also present with a history of physical trauma, infectious disease, tumor, or iatrogenic facial paralysis. Early repair within one year of injury can be achieved by direct nerve repair, cross-face nerve grafting or regional nerve transfer. It is due to muscle atrophy that in long lasting facial paralysis complex reconstructive methods have to be applied. Instead of one single procedure, different surgical approaches have to be considered to alleviate the various components of the paralysis. The reconstruction of a spontaneous dynamic smile with a symmetric resting tone is a crucial factor to overcome the functional deficits and the social handicap that are associated with facial paralysis. Although numerous surgical techniques have been described, a two-stage approach with an initial cross-facial nerve grafting followed by a free functional muscle transfer is most frequently applied. In selected patients however, a single-stage reconstruction using the motor nerve to the masseter as donor nerve is superior to a two-stage repair. The gracilis muscle is most commonly used for reconstruction, as it presents with a constant anatomy, a simple dissection and minimal donor site morbidity. Here we demonstrate the pre-operative work-up, the post-operative management, and precisely describe the surgical procedure of single-stage microsurgical reconstruction of the smile by free functional gracilis muscle transfer in a step by step protocol. We further illustrate common pitfalls and provide useful tips which should enable the reader to truly comprehend the procedure. We further discuss indications and limitations of the technique and demonstrate representative results.},

	abstract = {Background: One-stage microneurovascular free muscle transfer is a common surgical procedure for re-animation of established facial paralysis. However, innervation of the transferred muscle by the contralateral facial nerve prevents smile and other facial expressions on one side, and reinnervation requires about 7 months. To overcome these drawbacks, we report a dual innervation method using one-stage reconstruction with free latissimus dorsi muscle transfer. Methods: Three patients were treated with the dual innervation method, which is based on the one-stage method with some modifications: the soft tissue present over the ipsilateral masseter muscle and the hilum where the thoracodorsal nerve proceeds into the muscle segment is removed; the muscle is harvested to locate the hilum in the cranial one-third of the segment; and the muscle is transferred to the malar pocket of the paralysed face such that the hilum contacts the masseter muscle. Results: On average, muscle movement was recognised on voluntary biting at 3.4 months and on spontaneous smiling at 5.9 months after surgery. A dual innervation sign was recorded on electromyographs 6.4 months after surgery. The patients developed a spontaneous symmetrical smile and facial expressions on one side with minimum synkinesis after postoperative mirror rehabilitation. Conclusions: The advantages of the dual innervation method include faster reinnervation of the transferred muscle compared to one-stage options; achievement of spontaneous smile and voluntary smile on each side; augmentation of neural signals to the muscle for more symmetrical smiling; minimum synkinesis of the transferred muscle on biting for eyelid closure and emotional facial re-animation through a learning program to enhance cerebral cortical reorganisation.},

Methods: Seven cases with facial paralysis in late stage from December 1999 were treated and followed up for 10 months before clinical evaluation. In all of the cases, the sternal and clavicular branches of the sternocleidomastoid muscle were both elevated from their bony attachments, with the mastoid insertion left in situ as the pedicle for blood supply and accessory nerve maintained in it. The muscle strips were transposed and sutured to the orbicularis oris around the mouth corner on the paralyzed side. Results: Static asymmetry of nose and oral commissure on the paralyzed side were corrected immediately after operation, and the movement of the oral commissure recovered one week after operation. Symmetric smiling was observed in one month and all of the oral movements recovered in 10 months postoperatively. Conclusion: The new approach to repair facial paralysis in late stage by regional transposition of pedicled sternocleidomastoid muscle is effective in restoration of both static and dynamic symmetry of nose and mouth, and in recovery of the facial expression and the oral commissure.},

	title = {The gracilis free flap revisited: a review of 25 cases of transfer to traumatic extremity wounds},
	abstract = {Trauma to the extremities often results in a complex bony and soft-tissue injury requiring free flap reconstruction. Muscles from various body sites have been used in extremity reconstruction since the early 1970s. The gracilis muscle is usually not considered the first choice for free flap reconstruction of these defects. It is usually relegated to small defects or used to reanimate the face. Our purpose is to present our experience with the gracilis muscle as a first-choice flap in reconstruction of traumatic extremity defects. A retrospective review of all gracilis muscle free flap transfers for traumatic extremity wounds between 1988 and 1995 at the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth was performed. Twenty-five patients age 20 to 71 years (mean, 29.7 years) underwent 26 free flaps to the lower leg, ankle, foot, or forearm to cover traumatic wounds. Defects ranged in size from 3 x 3 cm (9 cm2) to 13 x 18 cm (234 cm2), with a mean of 75.5 cm2. There were no flap losses and all wounds healed. Nine patients experienced 11 complications, which consisted of minor wound separation (16\%), wound infection (12\%), partial or complete loss of split-thickness skin graft (8\%), thrombosis of graft with successful revascularization (4\%), and nonunion of an underlying fracture (4\%). Our overall success rate for gracilis free flap reconstruction of traumatic wounds is 100\%. The gracilis free muscle flap has become our first option for tissue coverage in traumatized extremities. It leaves minimal functional defect limited to the side of the primary injury and provides a good cosmetic result. It can cover large defects when the epimysium is cut, and allows an epidural block to be performed for sympathectomy effect and pain control in the affected extremity during the immediate postoperative period.},

The ideal reconstruction would include a fast-twitch muscle that is small, a reliable donor vessel and nerve, and the potential to provide a natural, synchronous, dentate smile with minimal donor site morbidity. Many flaps have been successfully used historically, but none has produced ideal rehabilitation. Objective: To evaluate the novel sterno-omohyoid, dual-vector flap in rehabilitation of chronic facial paralysis. Results: We performed sterno-omohyoid free tissue transfer for smile reanimation in a 39-year-old male with a history of longstanding right facial palsy following resection of a skull base tumor several years previously. We transferred both muscles with the superior thyroid artery, middle thyroid vein, and ansa cervicalis. The patient developed a dynamic smile by 6 months postoperatively, and he had improved objective facial symmetry. Conclusion: Herein, we demonstrate the first use of the sterno-omohyoid flap for successful facial reanimation. Overall, it is a novel flap in facial reanimation with many advantages over traditional flaps, including the potential to produce a more synchronous, dynamic smile while adding minimal bulk to the face.

All patients had intraoperative facial nerve monitoring, and facial nerve function was evaluated according the House-Brackmann (HB) scale. Results: Of all patients with immediate total paralysis, no patients achieved totally normal facial function (grade I), and only 5 (10\%) recovered to a grade II. For all groups included, the majority of patients (82\%) achieved an acceptable final facial function (grade III HB). In this series, only 2 patients remained with a grade VI facial function. Conclusions: The possibility of recovering near normal facial function after a grade VI facial paralysis is very low. Procedures like the immediate repair of the facial nerve with an interposed donor graft may provide better facial function in patients with partially injured facial nerve.

	abstract = {Microneurovascular free muscle transfer is the gold-standard surgical procedure for the reanimation of established facial paralysis. However, the innervation of the transferred muscle by the contralateral facial nerve is usually insufficient to produce a stable smile. Besides, the corner of the mouth sometimes moves unnaturally as if it were being pulled up because of the single-direction movement. Thus, we propose one-stage facial reanimation using free latissimus dorsi (LD)-serratus anterior (SA) combined muscle flap transfer with dual innervation. The LD-SA combined muscle flap was harvested with the thoracodorsal artery and vein as common vessels to move the corner of the mouth bidirectionally for natural smiling. The LD muscle was located in the same direction as the zygomaticus major muscle and reinnervated by dual innervation. The contralateral facial nerve was coapted with the thoracodorsal nerve, and the ipsilateral masseter motor nerve was inserted into the LD muscle by intramuscular neurotization. The 6th or 7th SA muscle was located in the same direction as the risorius muscle and reinnervated by neurorrhaphy of the long thoracic nerve and the thin branch of the ipsilateral masseter motor nerve. Since 2015, seven patients have been treated with this method without complications. On average, SA muscle movement was detected in voluntary biting at 3.1 months, and spontaneous smiling occurred 7.7 months after surgery. All patients developed a spontaneous natural smile. This method for established facial paralysis has the potential to improve the quality of the reconstructed smile and the unstable results of conventional single-innervation-single-muscle transfer.},

In the present study, the authors have described the technique involving grafting of the platysma muscle to restore eyelid function and retrospectively discussed its clinical outcomes. Methods: This retrospective analysis included patients with longstanding facial paralysis who underwent orbicularis oculi reconstruction with neurotized platysma grafts. The authors have described the surgical technique and its retrospective clinical outcomes. Results: Between 1992 and 2015, 38 consecutive patients underwent this procedure; of them, 34 [16 men (47 percent) and 18 women (53 percent)] completed the follow-up.

	abstract = {Background: Parotidectomy is a common treatment option for parotid neoplasms and the complications associated with this procedure can cause significant morbidity. Reconstruction following parotidectomy is utilized to address contour deformity and facial nerve paralysis. This study aims to demonstrate national trends in parotidectomy patients and identify factors associated with adverse postoperative outcomes. This study includes the largest patient database to date in determining epidemiologic trends, reconstructive trends, and prevalence of adverse events following parotidectomy. Methods: A retrospective review was performed for parotidectomies included in the ACS-NSQIP database between January 2012 and December 2017. CPT codes were used to identify the primary and secondary procedures performed. Univariate and multivariate analysis was utilized to determine associations between pre- and perioperative variables with patient outcomes. Preoperative demographics, surgical indications, and common medical comorbidities were collected. CPT codes were used to identify patients who underwent parotidectomy with or without reconstruction. These pre- and perioperative characteristics were compared with 30-day surgical complications, medical complications, reoperation, and readmission using uni- and multivariate analyses to determine predictors of adverse events. Results: There were 11,057 patients who underwent parotidectomy. Postoperative complications within 30 days were uncommon (1.7\% medical, 3.8\% surgical), with the majority of these being surgical site infection (2.7\%). Free flap reconstruction, COPD, bleeding disorders, smoking, and presence of malignant tumor were the strongest independent predictors of surgical site infection. Readmission and reoperation were uncommon at an incidence of 2.1\% each. The strongest factors predictive of readmission were malignant tumor and corticosteroid usage. The strongest factors predictive of reoperation were free flap reconstruction, malignant tumor, bleeding disorder, and disseminated cancer. Surgical volume/contour reconstruction was relatively uncommon (18\%). Facial nerve sacrifice was uncommon (3.7\%) and, of these cases, only 25.5\% underwent facial nerve reinnervation and 24.0\% underwent facial reanimation. Conclusions: There are overall low rates of complications, readmissions, and reoperations following parotidectomy. However, certain factors are predictive of adverse postoperative events and this data may serve to guide management and counseling of patients undergoing parotidectomy. Concurrent reconstructive procedures are not commonly reported which may be due to underutilization or underreporting.},

The authors present their experience with this procedure and analyze the postoperative complications and long-term functional and aesthetic outcomes. Methods: From March of 1990 to March of 2010, 45 patients underwent the free abductor hallucis muscle transfer procedure in the authors' department. Forty-one were followed up for 54.6 months (range, 28 months to 17 years). The Toronto Facial Grading System and Facial Nerve Function Index were used to evaluate facial nerve function at 2 years after surgery and last follow-up. Complications and function of the donor foot were analyzed. Results: No postoperative mortality was found. Complications occurred in four of 41 patients, including muscle loss, infection, hematoma, and hypertrophic scar. The others obtained satisfactory symmetric faces in the static state and in voluntary contraction of the transferred muscles. Mean values for the Toronto Facial Grading System (50.6¬¨¬±7.8) and the Facial Nerve Function Index (65.7¬¨¬±11.4 percent) were significantly higher at 2 years postoperatively in comparison with preoperative status (21.2¬¨¬±5.3 and 19.5¬¨¬±3.6 percent, respectively) (p{\textless}0.05).

	abstract = {Background: Hypoglossal nerve transfer is frequently employed to reanimate the paralyzed facial muscles after irreversible proximal facial nerve injury. However, it can cause significant postoperative synkinesis because it involves the reinnervation of the whole mimetic musculature using a single motor source. Objective: To describe our experience with differential reanimation of the miDFace and lower face using separate motor sources in patients with short-term facial paralysis after brain surgery. Methods: Seven patients underwent combined nerve transfer (the masseteric nerve to the zygomatic branch and the hypoglossal nerve to the cervicofacial division of the facial nerve) and cross-facial nerve grafting with the aim of achieving a spontaneous smile. The median duration of paralysis before surgery was 7 mo and follow-up ranged from 7 to 31 mo (mean: 18 mo). For evaluation, both physical examination and video analysis were performed. Results: In all patients, reanimation of both the miDFace and the lower face was successful. A nearly symmetrical resting lip was achieved in all patients, and they were able to voluntarily elevate the corners of their mouths without visible synkinesis and to close their eyes while biting. No patient experienced impairment of masticatory function or tongue atrophy. Conclusion: Differential reanimation of the miDFace and lower face with the masseteric and hypoglossal nerves is an alternative method that helps to minimize synkinetic mass movement and morbidity at the donor site.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Recovering a certain degree of mimicry after sacrifice of the facial nerve is a clinically recognized finding. The authors report a case of hemifacial reanimation suggesting a phenomenon of neurotization from muscle-to-nerve. Clinical case: A woman benefited from a parotidectomy with sacrifice of the left facial nerve indicated for recurrent tumor in the gland. The distal branches of the facial nerve, isolated at the time of resection, were buried in the masseter muscle underneath. The patient recovered a voluntary h‚Äö√†√∂¬¨¬©mifacial motricity. The electromyographic analysis of the motor activity of the zygomaticus major before and after block of the masseter nerve showed a dependence between mimic muscles and the masseter muscle. Discussion: Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain the spontaneous reanimation of facial paralysis. The clinical case makes it possible to argue in favor of muscle-to-nerve neurotization from masseter muscle to distal branches of the facial nerve. It illustrates the quality of motricity that can be obtained thanks to this procedure. Conclusion: The authors describe a simple implantation technique of distal branches of the facial nerve in the masseter muscle during a radical parotidectomy with facial nerve sacrifice and recovery of resting tone but also a quality voluntary mimicry.},

	abstract = {Background: Reconstructive surgeons may encounter patients presenting after intracranial facial nerve resection and grafting in the setting of skull base tumors, who inquire regarding progression, final facial function, and need for future operations. Study goals were to analyze global and regional facial function using established grading systems and videography, while examine variables possibly affecting outcomes. Methods: Between 1997 and 2012, 28 patients underwent intracranial nerve grafting. Fifteen were prospectively evaluated by three facial nerve physical therapists with the Facial Nerve Grading System 2.0 and the Sunnybrook Facial Grading Score for function and the Facial Disability Index for quality of life. Still photographs and videography were used to assess quality of motion and tone, while demographic and medical variables were analyzed regarding their effect on end results. Results: Average patient age was 41.9 years (range, 22 to 66 years), and there were 10 women and five men. Average time interval between nerve grafting and evaluations was 42.9 months (range, 12 to 146 months). Both grading scores demonstrated best outcomes in the periorbita and worst outcomes in the brow. Buccinator muscle tone also improved. The average total Facial Disability Index was 67.5 percent. Although not statistically significant, the data suggest that nerve gap length affected total resting symmetry and voluntary movement, whereas preoperative palsy and age may affect total resting symmetry. Perioperative radiation therapy, tumor type, donor nerve, and coaptation technique were not found to affect outcomes. Conclusions: Intracranial facial nerve grafting largely provides better resting tone and facial symmetry, potentially improving end results of future intervention; however, overall voluntary facial motion is poor. Clinical question/level of evidence: Therapeutic, IV.},

	title = {Temporalis muscle transfer for facial paralysis: a further refinement},
	abstract = {Facial nerve paralysis can occur due to failure of the central driving mechanism (nuclear or supranuclear pathology), failure of the conduit between the brainstem and the peripheral musculature (the facial nerve), or failure of the peripheral end organ (the neuromuscular system). Where the peripheral neuromuscular system fails, the options for dynamic reanimation include a regional muscle transfer driven by another ipsilateral cranial nerve, or a free muscle transfer driven by the contralateral facial nerve. Temporalis muscle transfer is an example of regional muscle transfer and has been used since early in the twentieth century. A further refinement, involving mobilization of the coronoid process of the mandible in continuity with the insertion of the temporalis muscle via a nasolabial fold approach, using fascial strips to re-create movement around the mouth, is presented.},

	title = {Triple innervation for re-animation of recent facial paralysis},
	abstract = {Recent facial palsies are those in which fibrillations of the mimetic musculature remain detectable by electromyography (EMG). Such fibrillations generally cease 18-24 months after palsy onset. During this period, facial re-animation surgery seeks to supply new neural inputs to the facial nerve. Neural usable sources were divided into qualitative (contralateral facial nerve) and quantitative (hypoglossus and masseteric nerve), depending on the type of stimulus provided. To further improve the extent and quality of facial re-animation, we here describe a new surgical technique featuring triple neural inputs: the use of the masseteric nerve and 30\% of the hypoglossus nerve fibres as quantitative sources was associated with the contralateral facial nerve (incorporated via two cross-face nerve grafts) as a qualitative source in order to restore facial movements in 24 consecutive patients. The use of two quantitative motor nerve sources together with a qualitative neural source appears to improve re-animation after facial paralysis, despite earlier doubts as to whether patients could use different nerves to produce facial movements. In fact, movement was much improved. Smiling according to emotions and blinking seem to be better assured if cross-face nerve grafting is performed in two steps rather than one.},

	abstract = {The current concepts in the aesthetic and functional reconstruction of complex oromandibular defects are presented with a case of a patient with self-inflicted gunshot wound to the face. The patient presented with a 6 cm composite mandibular defect; the buccomandibular and suborbital aesthetic zones of the cheek along with the mucosa lining, and the ipsilateral facial musculature were missing. A rapid prototyping model of the facial skeleton was used to assist in preoperative planning. A single stage reconstruction with two free flaps was planned; a free fibula osseous flap to reconstruct the mandibular defect, and a free chimeric ALT/functioning vastus lateralis muscle. The one skin paddle of the chimeric flap reconstructed the buccomandibular/suborbital zones of the cheek, and the other the lining of the mouth. The functional muscle provided reanimation of the corner of the mouth by coapting the muscle's motor nerve to the ipsilateral marginal mandibular nerve. A good facial contour and reanimation of the mouth with oral continence was achieved, and the patient presented with good social and emotional smile. This first report of combined use of a fibula osseous flap with a chimeric functional ALT/Vastus Lateralis flap suggests that the chimeric flap principle may be used in complex aesthetic and functional challenges of severe facial trauma.},

	abstract = {Background: M‚àö‚àÇbius syndrome (MS) can present with unilateral or bilateral facial paralysis. In performing 1-stage bilateral MS facial reanimation, we used bilateral spinal accessory (XI) nerves to innervate 2 free functional muscle transfers (FFMTs). Methods: Of 12 MS patients, 6 had bilateral facial paralysis. Bilateral gracilis were transferred and innervated using bilateral XI nerves. Results were evaluated using smile excursion score, cortical adaptation stage, and patient satisfaction questionnaire. Results: In all, 13 FFMTs were performed (with 1 gracilis failure). Mean smile excursion score improved from 0.7 to 3.4 (out of 5) postoperatively. Four patients achieved spontaneous smile, 1 achieved independent smile, and 1 achieved dependent smile. Mean satisfaction score was 2.8 (out of 5). Conclusions: One-stage bilateral FFMTs neurotized by bilateral XI nerves are effective in treating bilateral MS patients. Careful patient selection, adequate neurologic and psychologic examination, and postoperative smile training are all important factors in achieving optimal outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background Extirpation of aggressive parotid or cutaneous facial tumors often involves facial nerve sacrifice and the creation of a large soft-tissue defect. We describe a method for single-stage reconstruction during radical parotidectomy to restore facial form and function without additional morbidity. Methods We conducted a review of immediate reconstruction/reanimation of radical parotidectomy defects with the use of anterolateral thigh (ALT) fat and fascia flaps for facial contouring, orthodromic temporalis tendon transfer (OTTT), cable grafting of the facial nerve, and fascia lata lower lip suspension. Results Five patients (mean age, 67.4 years) underwent extirpation of malignant tumors with facial nerve sacrifice resulting in large soft-tissue deficits. All patients had ALT free tissue transfer to correct facial contour defects and OTTT to restore facial form and function. Four patients underwent cable grafting of facial nerve branches. Branches of the motor nerve to the vastus lateralis harvested from the ALT surgical site were used for cable nerve grafting in 3 patients. Fascia lata from the same ALT harvest site was used for lower lip suspension to the OTTT in 4 patients. There were no donor site complications. All patients achieved miDFacial symmetry at rest, oral competence with dynamic corner-of-mouth movement, and full eye closure. Conclusions Tumor clearance, symmetric facial appearance, as well as dynamic facial rehabilitation were accomplished in a single-stage procedure using the method described herein. The ALT free flap provides versatile options for soft-tissue defects as well as access to motor nerves optimal for grafting without additional morbidity. Patients undergoing extirpation of malignant tumors requiring facial nerve sacrifice can undergo immediate free tissue contour reconstruction and facial reanimation procedures with no additional morbidity.},

	abstract = {Hypoglossal-facial anastomosis provides excellent motor supply to the mimetic muscles of the face when there is no chance of recovery of the damaged facial nerve. However, to achieve optimal results, the timing of facial nerve surgery based on electrophysiological testing and clinical evaluation requires close follow-up of the patient. Functional results after delayed surgery are not predictable and depend on the number of surviving fibers, type of injury, severity of damage, degree of infiltration of inflammatory cells, and local fibrosis. Facial hypertonia, synkinesis, and involuntary mass movement are the major problems of delayed reanimation of the facial nerve. Surgery in the vicinity of the facial nerve always aims to preserve neural integrity. However, immediate facial nerve grafting is sometimes required. We present our experience with 4 patients having normal facial function prior to surgery. The facial nerve was severed due to tumor infiltration and instantaneously reconstructed with the hypoglossal nerve. Two patients had House-Brackmann grade-II 10 days and 28 months after surgery, respectively, and another 2 patients had House-Brackmann grade-III facial paralysis 2 weeks and 6 months after surgery, respectively.},

	abstract = {Background: This article describes facial reanimation using the transfer of the trigeminal motor nerve branch of the masseter muscle (masseter nerve) to the facial nerve (masseter-to-facial nerve transfer). Methods: A retrospective review was performed of 10 consecutive facial paralysis patients treated with a masseter-to-facial nerve transfer for reanimation of the miDFace and perioral region over a 7-year period. Patients were evaluated with physical examination, direct measurement of commissure excursion, and video analysis. Results: All patients regained oral competence, good resting tone, and a smile, with a vector and strength comparable to those of the normal side. Motion developed an average of 5.6 months after masseter-to-facial nerve transfer, with 40 percent of patients developing an effortless smile by postoperative month 19. Conclusions: The masseter-to-facial nerve transfer is an effective method for reanimation of the miDFace and perioral region in a select group of facial paralysis patients. The technique is advocated for its limited donor-site morbidity, avoidance of interposition nerve grafts, and potential for cerebral adaptation, producing a strong, potentially effortless smile.},

	title = {Assessment of functional outcomes of temporalis muscle transfers for patients with longstanding facial paralysis},
	abstract = {Background: Usually, clinical evaluation of facial reanimation provides accurate information about contraction of the mimetic muscles and phonation but fails to identify smile recovery and to quantify the motility of the lower third of the face during a smile. The purpose of this study was to verify that, in longstanding facial palsy, the modified temporalis muscle transfer (MTMT) can result in the ability to smile, not only voluntarily with chewing, but also spontaneously with a sudden emotional stimulus, and to confirm that a symmetric smile can be obtained. Methods: Ten patients of the treated group (group T; 4 women and 6 men) were randomly selected from a population of 24 patients with longstanding facial palsy treated by MTMT. Five normal subjects of the control group (group C; 3 women and 2 men) were enrolled as the control population. Functional outcomes after transposed temporalis muscle were examined and measured through clinical assessment by using a scored smile symmetry grading system, video recording, and surface electromyography (sEMG). In addition, the voluntary smile test (VST) and the not-voluntary smile test (NVST) were performed to study voluntary and spontaneous smiling. Results: Subjects in the VST group (group T) were able to smile voluntarily and the expression was characterized by symmetry. In the NVST group, they were able to smile spontaneously and the symmetry of the smile was maintained for 8 subjects and only partially for 2 subjects. During both tests, the temporalis muscle of the treated side and the orbicularis oris muscle of the not-treated side were activated during smiling, indicating spontaneous activity of the transposed temporalis muscle with an emotional stimulus. For the control group, smiles during VST and NVST were symmetric and the temporalis muscles were not activated during smiling, whereas the orbicularis oris muscles were. Conclusion: Our study shows that the Morrison MTMT is able to restore the voluntary smile ability. Particularly, this technique allows for recovery of the spontaneous smile with symmetry. This assessment would seem to suggest that the transposed temporalis muscle might adapt from a chewing to a mimetic muscle. ¬¨¬®¬¨¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38: E1535-E1543, 2016.},

The utility of flaccid unilateral facial paralysis and unilateral moderate to severe postparalytic facial nerve syndrome with synkinesis may be challenging to discern from photographs alone. Objective: To determine the societal health utility of flaccid unilateral facial paralysis, unilateral moderate to severe postparalytic facial nerve syndrome, and post-facial reanimation using standard video. Design, setting, and participants: This survey study was conducted at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear and the Harvard Decision Science Laboratory from June 14, 2017, to August 3, 2017. Healthy adult na‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√≤ve observers were recruited through advertising in the Cambridge, Massachusetts, area. Participants (n = 298) completed the web-based, interactive survey in person. The survey comprised clinical vignettes consisting of symptom summaries, videos, and pictures depicting 5 health states. Main outcomes and measures: Adult na‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√≤ve observers ranked the utility of 5 randomized health states (flaccid unilateral facial paralysis, unilateral moderate to severe postparalytic facial nerve syndrome, post-facial reanimation, monocular blindness, and binocular blindness) according to the visual analog scale (VAS), standard gamble (SG), and time trade-off (TTO) measures. Standard videos of patients' facial function were used. Results: In total, 377 na‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√≤ve observers were recruited and completed the survey in its entirety. Of the 377 participants, 298 (79.0\%) were included for analysis. Among the 298 participants, 151 (50.7\%) were female, 146 (49.0\%) were male, with a mean (SD) age of 33.0 (15.1) years. No differences in health utility scores (SD) were observed between flaccid unilateral facial paralysis and unilateral moderate to severe postparalytic facial nerve syndrome (VAS: 0.598 [0.213] vs 0.629 [0.207]; SG: 0.714 [0.245] vs 0.748 [0.237]; TTO: 0.716 [0.248] vs 0.741 [0.247]). Both health states rated substantially worse than monocular blindness (VAS: 0.691 [0.212]; SG: 0.817 [0.204]; TTO: 0.826 [0.196]) and post-facial reanimation (VAS: 0.742 [0.189]; SG: 0.833 [0.206]; TTO: 0.838 [0.19]). Conclusions and relevance: Health utility scores for flaccid unilateral facial paralysis and unilateral moderate to severe postparalytic facial nerve syndrome appeared to be equivalent and worse than that for monocular blindness, whereas scores for post-facial reanimation were substantially higher than the scores for the 2 facial movement disorders. These findings may provide insights into the societal advantages of facial reanimation surgery. Level of evidence: NA.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Rubin observed that there was a great deal of variation in smiles. [Rubin LR. The anatomy of a smile: its importance in the treatment of facial paralysis. Plast Reconstr Surg 1974;53:384-7] Smile reconstruction requires an understanding of the facial movements that occur during a normal smile. Facial reanimation should be tailored for each individual patient so that the movements on the reconstructed side are similar to that on the normal side. Aim: The aim of this study is to produce a quantitative analysis of smiles, as a basis for smile reconstruction and to compare our subject's smiles to the classification suggested by Rubin. Method: The smiles of 71 volunteers were analysed using three-dimensional (3D) stereophotogrammetry in x, y and z vectors. Each subject had the distances and angles of 10 surface landmarks (cheilion left and right (L\&R), labiale superius/inferius, mid-lateral upper/lower lip (L\&R), nasolabial fold (L\&R)) moved from the relaxed position to that in a maximum smile. All subjects' smiles were classified into the Rubin subtypes of corner of the mouth, canine and full-denture smile. Results: The average distances and angles moved by oral landmarks during a smile in a 3D plane were–cheilion: 16.6mm at 31 degrees ; labiale superius: 8.2mm at 31 degrees; upper mid-lateral lip: 10.5mm at 25 degrees; labiale inferius: 5.3mm at -56 degrees; lower mid-lateral lip: 7.8mm at 41 degrees and nasolabial fold: 12.6mm at 33 degrees . Our population results for the smile subtypes suggested by Rubin were–corner-of-the-mouth smile: 77\%, canine smile: 15\% and full-denture smile: 8\%. Conclusion: Our study offers a simple quantitative method for measuring the smile to assess the outcome of reanimation surgery between different surgical procedures and units. Proportions of our study group with corner-of-the-mouth, canine and full-denture smiles were consistent with Rubin's study.},

	abstract = {Background: A chance observation of return of excellent facial movement, after 18 months following the first stage of cross-face nerve grafting, without free functional muscle transfer, in a case of long-standing facial palsy, lead the senior author (RBA) to further investigate clinically. Patients and methods: This procedure, now christened as cross-face nerve extension and neurotization, was carried out in 12 patients of very long-standing facial palsy (mean 21 years) in years 1996-2011. The mean patient age and duration of palsy were 30.58 years and 21.08 years, respectively. In patients, 1-5 a single buccal or zygomatic branch served as a donor nerve, but subsequently, we used two donor nerves. The mean follow-up period was 20.75 months. Results: Successive patients had excellent to good return of facial expression with two fair results. Besides improved smile, patients could largely retain air in the mouth without any escape and had improved mastication. No complications were encountered except synkinesis in 1 patient. No additional surgical procedures were performed. Conclusion: There is experimental evidence to suggest that neurotization of a completely denervated muscle can occur by the formation of new ectopic motor end plates. Long-standing denervated muscle fibres eventually atrophy severely but are capable of re-innervation and regeneration, as validated by electron microscopic studies. In spite of several suggestions in the literature to clinically validate functional recovery by direct neurotization, the concept remains anecdotal. Our results substantiate this procedure, and it has the potential to simplify reanimation in longstanding facial palsy. Our work now needs validation by other investigators in the field of restoring facial animation.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Due to the widespread use of Free Functional Muscle Transplant (FFMT) around the world to reanimate the paralysed face, it is important to be aware of ethnic differences in facial movements. Methods and material: Participants in this study were born in Taiwan (n=24) and Austria (n=24). Analyses were conducted applying the digitised three-dimensional video-analysis system. All 48 subjects have never undergone any treatments in the face nor did they have previous histories of craniofacial anomalies. Results: In general, Europeans were observed to have larger facial movements than Asians, from 0.4 mm (e.g. 5.7\%) up to 3.9 mm (e.g. 30.3\%), on average 1.3 mm+/-0.82 SD (e.g. 20.6\%). Particularly the eyebrow, nose and mouth regions show statistically significant larger excursions on average 1.4 mm (e.g. 19.9\%), 1.3 mm (e.g. 34.6\%) and 3.0 mm (e.g. 30.3\%). One exception is in the eye region, where Asians have a larger excursion (1.4 mm, e.g. 15.8\%) of the eyelids, due to the larger distances between the upper and lower eyelids in the rest position. Conclusion: Europeans have generally larger facial movements than Asians. Particularly the eyebrow, nose and mouth regions show statistically significant larger excursions; exception must be made to the eye region, where Asians have a larger excursion of the eyelids. This is the first step to gather essential information about the ethnical differences in facial movements, a factor that should be considered as FFMT is becoming more popular worldwide.},

	abstract = {Background: Total parotidectomy with facial nerve sacrifice creates 2 challenging reconstructive problems: restoration of facial contour and facial nerve rehabilitation. Strong evidence suggesting that vascularized nerve grafts are superior to nonvascularized nerve grafts motivated our team to develop a chimeric scapulodorsal flap combining the usual harvestable local tissues with the vascularized latissimus dorsi motor nerve (SD-LDVxN). We present our experiences developing a new program at University of California, San Diego, highlighting our first case here, and present preliminary retrospective results focusing on the functional outcomes of facial nerve reanimation. Materials and methods: The first case performed in the United States was a 57-year-old woman with stage IVA left parotid adenoid cystic carcinoma and House-Brackmann grade 6 facial palsy. She underwent total parotidectomy with facial nerve sacrifice and a free chimeric SD-LDVxN flap reconstruction. She had an unremarkable postoperative course, and 3- and 6-month follow-up functional results are reported. Preliminary functional results from our total series of 25 patients were reported. Results: At her 3-month follow-up, she was a House-Brackmann 5 with a static eFACE score of 37, dynamic eFACE score of 31, and smile eFACE score of 48. At her 6-month follow-up, she was a House-Brackmann 5 with a static eFACE score of 50, dynamic eFACE score of 27, and smile eFACE score of 53. Preliminary results from our total series of 25 patients with an average of 5 years of follow-up were a House-Brackmann 2.5 and eFACE scores of 83.1 for static facial symmetry, 67.5 for dynamic facial symmetry, and 77.7 for smile score. Twenty of the 25 patients had postoperative radiotherapy. No local tumor recurrence had been reported. The average reinnervation time was 9 months and ranged from 3 to 15 months. Conclusions: The SD-LDVxN flap is a highly resourceful solution to reconstruct complex parotid defects, especially those that sacrifice the facial nerve. The vascularized nerve graft allows for primary facial reanimation. Nerve recovery may be superior to what could be expected with a conventional nerve graft.},

	abstract = {A procedure for temporalis muscle transposition was used to reanimate the paralyzed face in 219 patients. In most cases, facial paralysis had followed an operation to remove an acoustic tumor. Analysis of the results showed this procedure to be highly successful and the method of choice, alone in cases of long-standing facial paralysis or to augment the effects of facial nerve grafting or hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis, in reanimating the mouth.

Complications occurred in 21\% of patients, with the most common being infection (12\% of patients). Since one of us began to use the procedure to reanimate the eye and mouth, results of temporalis muscle transposition have been improved by the following: (1) using the procedure to reanimate the mouth only; (2) performing revision surgery, most often tightening the corner of the mouth (25\% of patients), as indicated; (3) transposing only the midsection of the muscle; (4) implanting a prefabricated Silastic prosthesis to fill the muscle defect; (5) when indicated, lengthening the muscle with polytef (Gore-Tex+); and (6) placing the muscle in a tunnel lateral to the superficial musculoaponeurotic system to avoid injuring the underlying facial nerve should some spontaneous recovery of facial nerve function be possible.},

Setting: University-based tertiary referral center. Patients: Between 1976 and 2000, rehabilitative facial nerve surgery was performed on 70 adult patients with varying underlying diseases. Intervention: Three methods of facial nerve rehabilitative surgery were performed: end-to-end anastomosis, cable nerve graft interposition, and classic faciohypoglossal transposition. Main outcome measures: The House-Brackmann grade was scored at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months by the two senior authors. A favorable outcome was defined as House-Brackmann Grade {\textless}/= III. Other parameters recorded were repair technique, age, nerve rerouting, whether the repair was immediate or delayed, and the anatomic position of the nerve defect in relation to the geniculate ganglion. Results: Data were available on 66 patients (94\%), of whom 13 had an end-to-end anastomosis, 25 a cable nerve graft interposition, and 28 a classic faciohypoglossal transposition. At 24 months, a House-Brackmann Grade {\textless}/= III was achieved in 84.6\% of those who underwent end-to-end anastomosis, 56.0\% of those who underwent cable nerve graft interposition, and 25.0\% of those who underwent classical faciohypoglossal transposition. End-to-end anastomosis and cable nerve graft interposition were superior to classic faciohypoglossal transposition (log-rank test, p = 0.0013). Twenty-five percent of all cases demonstrated improvement in House-Brackmann grade after 24 months. Increasing age at the time of repair was associated with a poorer outcome (p = 0.03 on logistic regression). Conclusion: End-to-end anastomosis confers the best facial function, followed by cable nerve graft interposition and then classic faciohypoglossal transposition.

	abstract = {Gracilis free muscle transfer is considered the gold standard technique for facial reanimation in cases of facial palsy. However, it is limited by its long operative and recovery times, the need for a second surgical site, and its outcomes that can sometimes show miDFacial bulk and oral commissure malposition. Facial reanimation with lengthening temporalis myoplasty (LTM)-Labb‚àö¬© technique- carries the advantage of having a shorter surgical time, a faster recovery, and being a less invasive surgery. Almost all patients included in studies of LTM were evaluated by subjective methods, and very little quantifiable data was available. A 64-year-old woman presented with long-standing incomplete right facial palsy secondary to acoustic neuroma surgery. Since she was overweight (body mass index [BMI]: 43.9) and had several cardiovascular comorbidities (hypertension, dyslipidemia), she was not a good candidate for gracilis free muscle transfer. She was submitted to facial reanimation with LTM. Fourteen months after surgery, she presented excellent facial symmetry, both at rest and in contraction, while smiling. She was evaluated with the Facegram-3D, a technology that we have developed for dynamic evaluation of facial muscle contraction. The analysis showed symmetry at rest and contraction, according to Terzis and Noah. Regarding vertical and horizontal displacement, the postoperative movement was synchronized and with less fluctuations when compared with the preoperative period. Notably, the anatomical pair's trajectories were smoother. Similar velocity profiles were found between anatomical pairs, with less abrupt changes in velocity values, further supporting improved movement control. Comparing the symmetry index, which takes a theoretical maximum of 1.0 for perfect 3D symmetry, its value was 0.56 for the commissures and 0.5 for the midpoints in the preoperative period, having improved to 0.91 and 0.82, respectively, 3 months postoperatively. Good aesthetic and functional results were achieved using the Labb‚àö¬Æ technique. LTM is a good option in cases of long-standing facial paralysis, if the patient desires a single-stage procedure with almost immediate dynamic function. Moreover, this technique assumes extreme importance in facial reanimation of patients of advanced age, overweight, or those who have several comorbidities.},

	abstract = {Background: Although they are traditionally reserved for "aesthetic refinement" in the latter stages of facial reanimation surgery, the author uses a variety of autogenous fascia lata grafts in a very aggressive approach as the primary therapeutic option in static facial rebalancing and/or in conjunction with dynamic muscle transfers to achieve architectural integrity and functional restoration of the totally or partially paralyzed face. Methods: Forty-nine autogenous fascia lata grafts, harvested through serial incisions in the lateral thigh, were placed in 35 totally or partially paralyzed faces. The grafts were categorized by anatomical location: I and II, lateral lip in totally paralyzed and partially paralyzed faces, respectively; III, nostril suspension; IV, lower eyelid suspension; V, bimalar lower lip sling; and VI, platysma transfer/autogenous fascia lata extension for lower lip invagination. Results: In all group I and II cases, static balance of facial architecture was restored at 4 to 6 weeks (after swelling resolved). Average lip commissure displacement was corrected to within 0.5 cm of the horizontal axis. Subjective functional improvement in speech, fluid retention, and chewing was immediate in all cases. In group I (n = 10; median age, 10.5 years), a 60 to 100 percent symmetrical smile was achieved with voluntary gracilis contraction of 3 of 5 to 5 of 5. In group II (n = 20; median age, 33 years), with 16 sling only patients, one to two grades of voluntary risorius and lip elevator motion were achieved in most. When accompanied by a temporalis turnover flap, both risorius and lip elevator function improved two to three grades. In group III (n = 5), inspiratory collapse was ameliorated in all cases and nasal flow improved subjectively 80 to 100 percent. In group IV (n = 4), scleral show and keratitis were improved in all cases. In group V (n = 6), improved oral competence was achieved in all patients. In group VI (n = 4), static lip evagination was achieved in all cases; voluntary lip depressor function was two to four grades improved. Conclusions: Early placement of autogenous fascia lata restores static balance of the deeper facial architecture in repose. Functional improvement of chewing, fluid retention, speech articulation, smile symmetry, and ectropion is immediate. The psychological effect is also immediate, with achievement of self-esteem and acceptance by family and peers.},

	title = {Double-powered free gracilis muscle transfer for smile reanimation: {A} longitudinal optoelectronic study},
	abstract = {The choice of the motor donor nerve is a crucial point in free flap transfer algorithms. In the case of unilateral facial paralysis, the contralateral healthy facial nerve can provide coordinated smile animation and spontaneous emotional expression, but with unpredictable axonal ingrowth into the recipient muscle. Otherwise, the masseteric nerve ipsilateral to the paralysis can provide a powerful neural input, without a spontaneous trigger of the smile. Harvesting a bulky muscular free flap may enhance the quantity of contraction but esthetic results are unpleasant. Therefore, the logical solution for obtaining high amplitude of smiling combined with spontaneity of movement is to couple the neural input: the contralateral facial nerve plus the ipsilateral masseteric nerve. Thirteen patients with unilateral dense facial paralysis underwent a one-stage facial reanimation with a gracilis flap powered by a double donor neural input, provided by both the ipsilateral masseteric nerve (coaptation by an end-to-end neurorrhaphy with the obturator nerve) and the contralateral facial nerve (coaptation through a cross-face nerve graft: end-to-end neurorrhaphy on the healthy side and end-to-side neurorrhaphy on the obturator nerve, distal to the masseteric/obturator neurorrhaphy). Their facial movements were evaluated with an optoelectronic motion analyzer. Before surgery, on average, the paretic side exhibited a smaller total three-dimensional mobility than the healthy side, with a 52\% activation ratio and {\textgreater}30\% of asymmetry. After surgery, the differences significantly decreased (analysis of variance (ANOVA), p {\textless} 0.05), with an activation ratio between 75\% (maximum smile) and 91\% (maximum smile with teeth clenching), and {\textless}20\% of asymmetry. Similar modifications were seen for the performance of spontaneous smiles. The significant presurgical asymmetry of labial movements reduced after surgery. The use of a double donor neural input permitted both movements that were similar in force to that of the healthy side, and spontaneous movements elicited by emotional triggering.},

Although cable nerve grafting often leads to good nerve regeneration, severe synkinesis due to aberrant axonal regrowth is inevitable. In such situations, the use of 2 motor sources to differentially reanimate the upper and lower face could minimize synkinesis. Here we describe a method of total facial nerve reconstruction in which the upper and lower face are differentially reconstructed with the hypoglossal nerve and facial nerve, respectively, using 2 interpositional nerve grafts. Reconstruction of the lower face with the facial nerve restored voluntary and coordinated animation, and reconstruction of the upper face with the hypoglossal nerve restored frontalis muscle tone and eye closure. These results suggest that our method could serve as an alternative to conventional techniques that use only the facial or hypoglossal nerve.},

Temporalis muscle ensures the criteria for reanimation and is used widely as a result. Many modifications were described to improve the success of the classical technique. One of these modifications was reported by the senior author in 1999. Twice as much muscle mass (in thickness) to the upper eyelid than the lower was taken and passed submuscularly 5 to 6 mm away from the limbus and a thinner split was passed subcutaneously beneath the lower cilia. The aim of this study was to present the outcomes of the technique after 38 operations with 37 patients and to describe deep temporalis musculofascial-fatty flap to recover depression of temporalis muscle split donor area. Seventeen lower eyelids were evaluated as mild, 12 were as moderate, and 9 were as severe ectropion. One upper eyelid was evaluated as mild, 14 were as moderate, and 23 were as severe lagophthalmos preoperatively. Mean follow-up time was 28.8 months. Five patients had mild ectropion and 2 patients had mild lagophthalmos postoperatively at last follow-up.

	abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the use of a palpebral spring, a dynamic facial reanimation technique, in the management of lagophthalmos and exposure keratopathy secondary to facial nerve palsy. Methods: A palpebral spring was placed in 29 eyelids of 28 patients with symptomatic facial nerve palsy. Preoperative and postoperative symptoms, upper eyelid margin to midpupil distance, lagophthalmos, and exposure keratopathy were evaluated. Results: At an average of 83 months follow-up, preoperative symptoms improved or resolved in 26 (90\%) eyes. The upper eyelid margin to midpupil distance decreased and lagophthalmos and exposure keratopathy significantly improved after palpebral spring placement (p {\textless} 0.001). After modification of the technique by suturing the spring to the anterior tarsal surface, rather than encasing the tip in a silicone tube and letting it ride freely, tension of the spring required adjustment in 4 eyes (27\%). Dislocation of the spring from the tarsus without exposure through the skin was observed in 1 eyelid (7\%). The spring was replaced because of loss of function secondary to metal fatigue in 5 eyelids (33\%) after an average of 43 months. Exposure of the spring through the skin was observed in 2 eyelids (14\%) and required spring removal from 1 eyelid and replacement of the spring in the other. Conclusion: A palpebral spring is an effective treatment for lagophthalmos and exposure keratopathy in patients with facial nerve palsy who do not receive adequate relief from the static procedures of lower eyelid tightening and upper eyelid lowering. This technique significantly improved symptoms and signs in these patients while allowing some of the blink reflex.},

In clinical observation, patients with different levels of oral commissure drooping achieve different symmetry outcomes, despite undergoing the same surgical procedure.

We retrospectively analyzed 44 patients performed with masseteric-to-facial nerve transfer combined with static suspension. Patients were divided into two groups according to the level of oral commissure drooping: slight-asymmetry group (n = 24) and severe-asymmetry group (n = 20). Static and dynamic symmetry were assessed with FACE-gram software pre and postoperatively. The symmetry of the oral commissures at rest and during smiling significantly improved postoperatively in all patients. The differences of the bilateral oral commissure positions were significantly smaller in slight-asymmetry group than that in severe-asymmetry group (p{\textless}0.001), indicating that slight-asymmetry group achieved better symmetry. Furthermore, these differences were caused by the oral commissures position on the unaffected side, both pre and postoperatively (p{\textless}0.001), but not the paralyzed side's (p{\textgreater}0.05). In conclusion, masseteric-to-facial nerve transfer combined with static suspension achieved dynamic and static symmetry in patients with different levels of asymmetry. Patients with slight asymmetry obtained better postoperative symmetry than those with severe asymmetry.

	abstract = {Background: Incomplete facial paralysis is still a challenge because we must restore what is missing without causing damage to what has recovered. The current literature is insufficient, with a small number of cases. The use of nerve transfers has gained recent popularity for reanimating facial palsy. The authors present a comparative study between cross-face nerve grafting and masseteric-to-facial nerve transposition for incomplete facial paralysis. Methods: Twenty-eight patients with incomplete unilateral facial paralysis were reanimated with either cross-face nerve grafting (group I, n = 10) or masseteric nerve transfer (group II, n = 18). Commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity were measured using the FACIAL CLIMA dystem. Spontaneity of the movement and satisfaction were also assessed. Results: When comparing the reconstructed and the healthy sides, statistical differences were found in group I but not in group II, suggesting that the resulting movement was symmetrical in group II but not in group I. Intergroup comparison showed that both commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity were higher in group II. Spontaneity in group I was higher than in group II, but patients in group II showed more satisfaction, both without being statistically significant. Conclusions: Reanimation of incomplete facial paralysis can be satisfactorily achieved with both cross-face nerve grafting and direct masseteric-to-facial nerve transposition. However, with the masseteric nerve, better symmetry, a higher degree of recovery, and an increased level of satisfaction are achieved in a one-stage operation. Furthermore, both nerve sources are able to restore spontaneity in more than 50 percent of the patient's daily life, with no significant differences between them.

The gracilis muscle is a reliable free transfer with internal anatomy conductive to use for reanimation of the paralyzed face. This type of transfer, in our experience, has proved superior to nonmicrosurgical methods for treatment of complete and severe incomplete facial palsy.

The author has developed a technique involving masseteric nerve transfer combined with cross-facial nerve grafting for treating skull base surgery-induced facial paralysis. This paper aims to demonstrate that this procedure is effective and causes negligible donor site morbidity. Methods: Seven patients who developed facial paralysis after the removal of skull base tumors were treated with masseteric nerve transfer combined with cross-facial nerve grafting with the aim of reanimating the miDFace. The mean period of preoperative paralysis was 6 months. The follow-up period ranged from 22 to 65 months (mean: 46 months). The patients were evaluated with physical examinations and video analysis. Results: Successful reanimation of the miDFace was achieved in all patients except one, whose muscle tone recovered. On average, facial motion developed 4 months after the nerve transfer. Only minimal coordinated eyelid movement was seen during biting. None of the patients experienced impaired masticatory function or visible wasting of the masseter muscle. All of the patients who recovered the ability to contract their paralyzed muscles were able to close their eyes tightly during biting; however, none of the patients have been able to achieve an effortless spontaneous smile. Conclusions: Masseteric nerve transfer is an alternative method for selective reanimation of the miDFace and does not cause donor site morbidity.},

	title = {A comparative retrospective study: hypoglossofacial versus masseterofacial nerve anastomosis using {Sunnybrook} facial grading system},
	abstract = {Introduction: The aim of our study is to compare the functional results between two surgical techniques for reanimation of facial paralysis: hypoglossal-to-facial versus masseteric-to-facial nerve anastomosis. Methods: This is a retrospective study of 13 patients treated for complete facial paralysis in two medical tertiary centers. The patients were classified into two groups. First group: masseteric-to-facial nerve anastomosis. Second group: hypoglossofacial nerve anastomosis. Sunnybrook facial grading system was used to evaluate the functional results. The mean scores were compared using Mann-Whitney test. The correlation between the age at surgery, the delay in time from the onset of the facial paralysis to the time of surgery and the results of Sunnybrook scores was studied using correlation and linear regression. Results: No significant statistical difference was found between the mean of total score of the two groups (first group = 38 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 4.898, second group = 37.83 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 4.956). All the patients treated by hypoglossofacial nerve anastomosis presented with hemiglossal atrophy. We found slight superiority for the masseterofacial nerve anastomosis in dynamic movements, whereas at rest the hypoglossofacial anastomosis is slightly better. All the differences were not statistically significant. No correlation was found between the age at surgery (age range included 32-73 years) and post-operative results. No correlation was found between the delays up to 24 months from the onset of the facial paralysis and post-operative results. Conclusion: Our study showed that both types of anastomosis are effective with comparable results. The masseterofacial nerve anastomosis is preferred when possible to avoid the hemiglossal atrophy and its complications.},

	abstract = {Background: Corneal protection is a priority in flaccid facial palsy patients. Denervation of the orbicularis oculi muscle results in weak palpebral closure and predisposes patients to severe corneal sequelae. While periorbital static procedures enhance corneal coverage in repose, voluntary closure is only regained through dynamic reinnervation of the muscle. This study aims to elucidate the added effect of dynamic reinnervation of the orbicularis oculi muscle on long-term corneal integrity as well as on dynamic closure of the palpebral aperture. Methods: Retrospective review was performed on two groups of complete palsy patients: those who received solely periorbital static procedures and those who underwent concomitant orbicularis oculi muscle reinnervation and static lid procedures. Only patients with complete ophthalmic examinations were included. Corneal punctate epithelial erosions in addition to static and dynamic palpebral measurements were serially assessed preoperatively and postoperatively. Results: Of 272 facial palsy patients, 26 fit the inclusion criteria. Eleven patients underwent combined muscle reinnervation involving facial-to-masseteric nerve coaptation in addition to static eye procedures, and 15 patients underwent solely static interventions. Analysis revealed a 65.3 percent lower mean punctate epithelial erosion score in reinnervation patients as compared with static patients when evaluated at more than 9 months postoperatively (p {\textless} 0.01). Reinnervation patients were also found to have 25.3 percent greater palpebral aperture closure (p {\textless} 0.05) and 32.8 percent higher closure velocity (p {\textless} 0.01) compared with static patients. Conclusion: In patients with subacute facial palsy, dynamic reanimation of the orbicularis oculi muscle with concomitant static interventions provides lasting corneal protection not seen in patients who receive solely static interventions.

The procedure was performed for 61-year-old man 3-years after resection of a malignant tumor and a 24-year-old woman 10-years after temporal fracture with facial paralysis. A double-muscle flap comprising left LD and SA flaps was harvested, a 15-cm thoracodorsal nerve (TN) section was attached to the LD flap, and 5-cm and 1-cm sections of the long thoracic nerve (LTN) were attached to the proximal and distal sides of SA flap. The LD flap and SA flap were sutured along the direction of motion of the zygomaticus major and risorius muscles, respectively. The contralateral FN and ipsilateral MN were interconnected by nerve suturing: the medial branch of TN to the distal end of LTN, the proximal end of LTN to the ipsilateral MN, and the buccal branch of contralateral FN to the main trunk of TN. After surgery, good contraction of the transferred flaps resulted in reanimation of a natural symmetrical smile; no complications were observed during the 12-month follow-up period.},

	abstract = {Facial palsy is a severe condition that may be ameliorated by facial reanimation, but there is no consensus about how to judge its success. In this study we aimed to test a new method for assessing facial movements based on 3-dimensional analysis of the facial surfaces. Eleven patients aged between 42 and 77 years who had recently been affected by facial palsy (onset between 6 and 18 months) were treated by an operation based on triple innervation: the masseteric to temporofacial nerve branch, 30\% of the hypoglossal fibres to the cervicofacial nerve branch, and the contralateral facial nerve through two cross-face sural nerve grafts. Each patient had five stereophotogrammetric scans: at rest, smiling on the healthy side (facial stimulus), biting (masseteric stimulus), moving the tongue (hypoglossal stimulus), and corner-of-the-mouth smile (Mona Lisa). Each scan was superimposed onto the facial model of the "rest" position, and the point-to-point root mean square (RMS) value was automatically calculated on both the paralysed and the healthy side, together with an index of asymmetry. One-way and two-way ANOVA tests, respectively, were applied to verify the significance of possible differences in the RMS and asymmetry index according to the type of stimulus (p=0.0329) and side (p{\textless}0.0001). RMS differed significantly according to side between the facial stimulus and the masseteric one on the paralysed side (p=0.0316). Facial stimulus evoked the most asymmetrical movement, whereas the masseteric produced the most symmetrical expression. The method can be used for assessing facial movements after facial reanimation.},

	title = {Mixed facial reanimation technique to treat paralysis in medium-term cases},
	abstract = {Recent facial paralyses, in which fibrillations of the mimetic muscles are still detectable by electromyography (EMG), allow facial reanimation based on giving new neural stimuli to musculature. However, if more time has elapsed, mimetic muscles can undergo irreversible atrophy, and providing a new neural stimulus is simply not effective. In these cases function is provided by transferring free flaps into the face or transposing masticatory muscles to reinstitute major movements, such as eyelid closure and smiling. In a small number of cases, patients affected by paralysis are referred late - more than 18 months after onset. In these cases, reinnervating the musculature carries a high risk of failure because some or all of the mimetic muscles may atrophy irreversibly while axonal ingrowth is taking place. A mixed reanimation technique to address this involves a neurorrhaphy between the masseteric nerve and a facial nerve branch for the orbicularis oculi, to ensure a stronger innervation to that muscle, associated with the transposition of the temporalis muscle to the nasiolabial sulcus. This gives good symmetry in the rest of the miDFace, while smiling movement is achievable, but not guaranteed. This one-time facial reanimation is particularly indicated for those who refuse major free-flap surgery or when that may be risky, as in previously operated and irradiated fields. More extensive procedures based on utilizing a free flap to recover smiling, while adding a cross-face nerve graft to restore blinking, may be proposed for motivated patients. Between 2010 and 2015, five patients affected by complete unilateral facial palsy underwent this technique in the Maxillofacial Surgery Department, San Paolo Hospital (Milan, Italy). Symmetry of the middle-third of the face at rest and recovery of smiling was quite good. Complete voluntary eyelid closure was obtained in all cases. Combining temporalis flap rotation and a masseteric-to-orbicularis-oculi-facial-nerve branch neurorrhaphy seems to be a valid solution for those medium-term referred patients.},

	abstract = {Facial paralysis can severely impact functionality and mental health. Facial reanimation surgery can improve facial symmetry and movement. Zygomaticus minor (Zmin) and zygomaticus major (Zmaj) are 2 important perioral muscles, that function to elevate the upper lip, contributing to the formation of a smile. The objective of this study was to analyze the morphology in three-dimensional (3D) and quantify architectural parameters of Zmin and Zmaj. In ten formalin-embalmed specimens, Zmin and Zmaj were serially dissected and digitized at the fiber bundle level. The 2 muscles were modeled in 3D to construct high fidelity models. The 3D models were used to assess muscle morphology and quantify architectural parameters including mean fiber bundle length, physiological cross-sectional area, and line of action. Zygomaticus minor fiber bundles were oriented horizontally or slightly obliquely and had a muscular attachment to the medial modiolus. Zygomaticus minor was found to either have no partitions or medial and lateral partitions. Specimens with partitions were divided into type 1 and type 2. Type 1 consisted of a medial partition with fiber bundles attaching to the zygomatic bone at the inferior margin of the orbit. The type 2 medial partition attached to the lateral margin of the orbit to attach to the zygomatic bone. Zygomaticus major had obliquely oriented fiber bundles with most specimens having inferior and superior partitions attaching to the inferior aspect of the zygomatic bone. Zygomaticus major was found to have a greater mean fiber bundle length and physiological cross-sectional area than Zmin. The direction of the line of action of Zmin and Zmaj was closely related to fiber bundle arrangement. Detailed 3D anatomical understanding of Zmin and Zmaj, at the fiber bundle level, is critical for reconstructive surgeons performing dynamic facial reanimation. This data can be used to assist with selecting the ideal donor site for reconstruction.},

	title = {Free tissue transfer for the treatment of facial paralysis},
	abstract = {Long-standing facial paralysis requires the introduction of viable, innervated dynamic muscle to restore facial movement. The options include regional muscle transfer and microvascular free tissue transfer. There are advantages and disadvantages of each. Briefly, the regional muscle transfer procedures are reliable and provide immediate return of movement. However, the movement is not of a spontaneous mimetic nature. Free tissue transfer, in contrast, offers the possibility of synchronous, mimetic movement. It does, however, require a prolonged healing time in comparison with that of regional muscle transfer. The choice is made by physician and patient together, taking into account their preferences and biases. Muscle-alone free tissue transfer is our preferred option for reanimation of uncomplicated facial paralysis without skin or soft tissue deficits. Combined muscle and other tissue (most are skin flap) is another preferred option for more challenging complex facial paralysis with skin or soft tissue deficits after tumor excision. Gracilis flap is the author's first choice of muscle transplantation for both reconstructions. From 1986 to 2006, gracilis functioning free muscle transplantation (FFMT) was performed at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital for facial reanimation in 249 cases of facial paralysis. The main etiology is postoperative complication and Bell's palsy. The innervating nerve comes mostly from contralateral facial nerve branches, few from ipsilateral facial nerve due to tumor ablation, and from ipsilateral motor branch to masseter or spinal accessory nerve due to M‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√ábius syndrome. We have evolutionally used a short nerve graft (10 to 15 cm) to cross the face in the first stage; after a 6- to 9-month waiting period, gracilis FFMT was performed for the second stage of the reconstruction. The technique of evolution has shown encouraging results to achieve the goal of rapid restoration and fewer scars on the donor leg.},

	abstract = {Background: In the absence of a viable proximal nerve stump, damaged after surgical procedures around the skull base, numerous techniques for facial reanimation have been developed over time, aiming to restore baseline symmetry and active mimicry. Objective: To report experience using the masseteric nerve as a direct transfer to the facial nerve rerouted after intratemporal translocation. This paper illustrates the main steps of the technique and the quality of results. Methods: Eleven patients were treated with a masseteric direct transfer to the facial nerve. Its extratemporal rerouting toward the zygoma allowed tension-free coaptation between donor and recipient nerves. Results: Of the 11 patients, 8 had a good to excellent recovery, showing different patterns of time and scores, according to age, surgical timing, and masseteric nerve function quality. The return of activity in the frontalis muscle, never obtained after reinnervation via the hypoglossal nerve, is of particular interest. The quality of the smile can be improved with re-education and practice but remains under volitional control. A true emotional response is still lacking. Conclusion: The masseteric nerve is an excellent alternative to the hypoglossal nerve and can reinnervate the whole territory of the facial nerve rerouted after intratemporal translocation. The overall results are remarkable, but the low quality of the trigeminal nerve, eventually affected by the first surgery, may be an important limitation. Even if the patients appear more at ease in re-education than with other techniques, a fully natural facial expression remains impossible to obtain.},

The loss of function of one or both facial nerves has a remarkable impact on patients' lives. Objective: To retrospectively analyze the functional outcomes of microneurovascular facial reanimation using masseteric innervation. Methods: Seventeen patients with irreparable facial paralysis resulting from benign lesions involving the facial nuclei (n = 14) or M‚àö‚àÇbius syndrome (n = 3) were treated with free muscle flaps for oral commissural reanimation using ipsilateral masseteric innervation and using temporalis muscle transfer for eyelid reanimation. Results were analyzed by the absolute commissural excursion and commissural excursion index and by a patient self-evaluation score. Presence of synkinesis was documented. Follow-up ranged from 8 to 48 months (mean, 26.4 months). Results: Normalization of the commissural excursion index was observed in 8 of 17 patients (47\%), an improvement was seen in 7 of 17 (41\%), and failure was observed in 2 of 17 (12\%). The individual dynamics of absolute commissural excursion and commissural excursion index changes are presented. A natural smiling response was observed in 10 of 17 patients (59\%) but not in the remaining 7 (41\%). This response reflected the patient's ability to relay the natural emotion of smiling through the masseteric nerve. Patients' self-evaluation scores were a level higher than objective indices. Conclusions: Innervation of free muscle flaps with the masseteric nerve for oral commissure reanimation might play an important role in patients with lesions of the facial nuclei (as in M‚àö‚àÇbius syndrome). Synkinesis persists for long periods after surgery. However, most of the patients learned to express their emotions by overcoming this phenomenon. Despite hypercorrection or inadequate correction, patients evaluated themselves favorably.},

Temporalis muscle transfer is reliable for the reanimation of long-standing facial paralysis often employed when facial nerve reinnervation. It can be used as well for the immediate treatment of complete facial paralysis (more than 1 year) because temporalis muscle transposition does not interfere with neuronal regeneration. During the last few years the techniques employing the tendon of the temporalis muscle for the rehabilitation of the oral commissure gain increasing importance. The authors analyse the different options for reanimation after facial paralysis and report on a case of facial reanimation via temporalis muscle transfer.},

	abstract = {Importance: Free muscle transfer innervated by a cross-facial nerve graft represents the criterion standard for smile reconstruction in facial paralysis. If primary reconstruction fails, a second muscle transfer is usually needed. Herein, we investigated the possibility of avoiding a second free muscle transfer by in situ coaptation of the gracilis muscle to the masseteric nerve. Observations: We report a series of 3 failed free muscle transfers for facial reanimation among 21 free flap transfers performed for facial reanimation between March 2008 and August 2013. To salvage the muscle, we performed coaptation of the neural pedicle from the cross-facial nerve graft to the masseteric nerve. This method allows for leaving the fixation sutures of the muscle at the oral commissure in place. All patients showed muscle contraction after 3 months and a smile with open mouth after 6 months. No significant difference in the range of commissure excursion was observed between the healthy and operated sides. Conclusions and relevance: Recoaptation of the neural pedicle from the cross-facial nerve graft to the masseteric nerve, leaving the muscle transplant in place, is a suitable salvage procedure after unsuccessful reconstruction with a cross-facial nerve graft, avoiding a second free muscle transfer.

	abstract = {Objectives/hypothesis: Objectively measure the ability of facial reanimation surgery to normalize the appearance of facial paralysis using eye-tracking technology. Study design: Prospective randomized controlled experiment. Methods: An eye-tracker system was used to record the eye-movement patterns, called scanpaths, of 86 na‚àö√òve observers gazing at pictures of paralyzed faces (House-Brackmann IV-VI), smiling and in repose; before and after facial reanimation surgery; as well as normal, nonparalyzed faces. Observers gazed at each face for 10 seconds. Fixation durations for all predefined facial areas of interest were analyzed using mixed-effects linear regression. Results: Observers spent the majority of time (6.6 of 10 seconds) gazing in the central triangle region (eyes, nose, and mouth) of normal faces and paralyzed faces. There were significant deviations in fixation within the central triangle of paralyzed faces as compared to normal faces. Total fixation on the eyes remained conserved. However, total nose fixation decreased and mouth fixation increased on paralyzed faces. Facial reanimation surgery normalized many of the hemifacial gaze asymmetries caused by unilateral facial paralysis, and restored a normal distribution of gaze between the functional and paralyzed sides of the face and mouth. Conclusion: There were objective differences in the way observers directed their attention to facial features when viewing normal and paralyzed faces. After facial reanimation surgery, the attentional distraction caused by facial feature irregularities was reduced. These findings are important additions to the emerging body of objective evidence indicating the effectiveness of reanimation surgery; they also suggest opportunities to optimize reconstruction.

This stepwise approach was applied prospectively in 120 consecutive facial palsy patients from 1986 to 1990. The six stages included (a) supportive care (with and without tarsorrhaphy), (b) planning facial reanimation, (c) lower eyelid and lateral canthal resuspension, (d) passive upper eyelid reanimation, (e) dynamic eyelid animation (palpebral springs), and (f) soft tissue repositioning including eyebrow lift and blepharoplasty. Each stage was considered in order, although action in each stage was not appropriate for all patients. All 120 patients received supportive care, which was all that was necessary to accomplish the therapeutic goals for 63 (52.5\%). Eight patients received temporary tarsorrhaphies (7\%) and 14 (12\%) permanent. One hundred ten were considered for stage 2. Thirty-five underwent stage 3 procedures, 30 received gold weights in stage 4, 5 had palpebral springs placed in stage 5, and 6 underwent stage 6 procedures. This staged approach was effective in achieving corneal compensation, maintaining vision, and improving the quality of life in all patients.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The reconstructive goals following radical parotidectomy include restoration of symmetry, reanimation of the face, and reestablishment of oral competence. We present our experience utilizing the anterolateral thigh (ALT) free flap, orthodromic temporalis tendon transfer (OTTT), and facial nerve cable grafting to reestablish form and function. Material and methods: From 2010 to 2016, 17 patients underwent radical parotidectomy followed by immediate reconstruction. An ALT was harvested to accommodate the volume and skin defect. Additional fascia lata and motor nerve to vastus lateralis (MNVL) were obtained. Anastomosis of the ALT to recipient vessels was performed, most commonly using the facial artery and internal jugular vein. OTTT was performed by securing the medial tendon of the temporalis to orbicularis oris through a nasolabial incision. Fascia lata was tunneled through the lower lip, then secured laterally to the temporalis tendon. The MNVL was cable grafted from either the proximal facial nerve or masseteric nerve to the distal facial nerve branches. ALT fascia was suspended to the superficial muscular aponeurotic system. Results: Average follow up was 19 months. Only one patient failed to achieve symmetry attributed to dehiscence of OTTT. All patients achieved oral competence and dynamic smile with OTTT activation. Facial nerve recovery was seen in 8 patients. 5 reached a House Brackman Score of 3. Two donor site seromas and two wound infections occurred. Conclusion: Simultaneous ALT, OTTT, and facial nerve cable grafting provides early reestablishment of facial symmetry, facial reanimation, and oral competence with minimal morbidity.},

	abstract = {Background: Facial paralysis and postparalysis facial synkinesis both cause severe functional and aesthetic deficits. Functioning free muscle transplantation is the authors' preferred method for reconstructing both deformities. Methods: From 1985 to 2017, a total of 392 patients underwent 403 gracilis functioning free muscle transplantations for facial reanimation. Different motor neurotizers were used: cross-face nerve graft (74 percent), spinal accessory nerve (17 percent), and masseter nerve (8 percent). Smile excursion score, cortical adaptation stage, patient questionnaire, Hadlock lip excursion, and the Terzis evaluation systems were used to assess outcomes. Results: For smile excursion score, the spinal accessory and masseter nerve groups showed higher scores than the cross-face nerve graft group in the first 2 years, but no difference by 3-year follow-up. For cortical adaptation stage, nearly all cross-face nerve graft patients achieved stage IV or V spontaneity, the spinal accessory nerve group achieved at least stage III (independent) movement, but individuals in the masseter nerve group achieved only stage III or less. The cross-face nerve graft group also achieved higher scores according to the Hadlock system and the Terzis evaluation system compared with the other two groups. Conclusions: The concept of "sugarcane chewing" where the sweetness is the least at the tail but the most at the head can be simply applied for surgeons and patients in weighing the benefits and drawbacks during the motor neurotizer selection. Cross-face nerve graft-innervated gracilis is analogous to chewing sugarcane from tail to head; despite lower outcome measures earlier, it yields the highest scores at 3 years postoperatively. Masseter-innervated gracilis is akin to chewing sugarcane from head to tail, with greater outcome scores initially but little improvement at longer follow-up. Spinal accessory-innervated gracilis results fall in between these two groups. Clinical question/level of evidence: Therapeutic, IV.},

This case study presents an eight-year old girl with Moebius Syndrome (MC) who received 30 sessions of speech therapy. This occurred after presenting to clinic 11 months after left facial reanimation with gracilis thigh muscle transfer surgery. On examination, only flickers of left facial movement were observed. There was no movement on the right side of the face. As a consequence of the minimal movement, MC presented with drooling and unintelligible speech. The purpose of speech therapy was three fold: minimise the pooling of saliva, improve the placement of the articulators so that articulation of speech sounds would be more accurate, and gain advances in overall intelligibility. Methods: Therapy focussed on speech, facial movement and saliva management using a combination of speech drills, evidence-based articulation therapies, facial exercises with surface electromyography biofeedback, self-awareness training and compensatory saliva management strategies. Results: After a course of 30 one-hour speech therapy sessions, substantial improvements were seen in speech sound accuracy, overall intelligibility, facial movement and saliva control. Conclusions: The combination of surgery and speech therapy led to functional gains that surgery alone did not achieve. The impact of speech therapy on surgical outcomes in individuals with Moebius syndrome deserves further investigation.},

Sixty-nine patients had Gillies and McLaughlin combination, 12 patients had Gillies and 33 patients had McLaughlin procedure alone. Patient satisfaction was generally high ({\textgreater}80\%) and highest when McLaughlin procedure alone was performed and in patients without comorbidities. Reoperations were performed in 80 patients (70\%; mean 2.2 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 1.7) and complications affected 16 patients (14\%).

	abstract = {From the authors three-dimensional video analyses they had to learn that the advantages of a one-stage procedure is outweighed by far by the disadvantages. A three-stage concept to a one-stage procedure was preferred for the following reasons: 1. Safety of having a cross-face nerve graft to cover the distance from the healthy facial nerve to the nerve of the muscle transplant without problems and without the danger of tension on the nerve suture line because of shortage of the muscle nerve. 2. Independence of anatomical variations like a very proximal muscle hilus in the latissimus dorsi muscle e.g., resulting in a too short muscle nerve. 3. Only face-lift incisions are necessary without the need of an additional incision in the nasolabial fold while using a cross-face nerve graft. 4. Freedom of positioning the muscle graft on the paralyzed side with free choice of the position of the transplant hilus. 5. The superficial temporal vessels can be used for microvascular anastomoses. 6. Prevention of a scar in the submandibular region with its tendency of hypertrophy, especially if it is connected to the preauricular incision. Different functional territories of one muscle transplant for eye closure and for smile is only possible in combination with two cross-face nerve grafts. Further on the three-dimensional video analysis showed clearly that Final surgical corrections for improvement of the static and dynamic symmetry should be performed. when the muscle transplant or the transposed muscle have gained their final functional result, which is often not before one or one and a half year after muscle transplantation. Therefore a three-stage concept is needed for the majority of patients. Detailed analyses of the movements in the different regions and the comparison of both sides clarify preoperatively the indication for the operative techniques to be used, and describe exactly the improvement of the overall result. It is not only possible to show, eg, the better positioning of the alar of the nose by a nasolabial dermal suspension plasty on the paralyzed side in millimeter, but also the influence on the relation of all the different points in the face (Fig. 5). The comparison of the right and the left side gives exact data on the symmetry of the face on rest and during the different movements. Of course, also qualities of facial reanimation like prevention of mass movements or synkinesias are detected in the three-dimensional graphs of all the points at the same time or in the repeated reviews of the original movement in the original video sequence. In conclusion, three-dimensional video analysis of facial movements became an important tool for online planning of operative procedures for the individual patient, and an excellent tool for comparative studies of different operative concepts and alternative operative techniques within a standardized registry of one center treating facial palsy or within international multicenter studies.},

	abstract = {Importance: Gracilis free muscle transfer is widely regarded as the gold standard functional smile reanimation in long-standing facial palsy. Although most patients achieve meaningful oral commissure movement, a subset has suboptimal aesthetic outcomes due to miDFacial bulk or oral commissure malposition. Safe refinements that do not compromise excursion would be a welcome addition to the surgical armamentarium for this population. Objectives: The goal of this study was to describe surgical approaches to the 3 most common postoperative sequelae that detract from the final result after gracilis facial reanimation and to examine how these surgical refinements affect aesthetic outcome, smile excursion, and quality of life. Design: This was a retrospective case series. Setting: Tertiary care center (Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Facial Nerve Center). Participants: Of 260 gracilis transfers performed since 2003, meaningful excursion ({\textgreater}3 mm) but poor aesthetic outcome requiring additional surgery was noted in 21 patients and was related either to excess muscle bulk (9), resting inferior malposition of the oral commissure (9), or resting superior/lateral malposition of the oral commissure (3). Intervention: Specific surgical interventions to address each of these negative sequelae were developed and refined, to preserve muscle functionality but eliminate the unsightly feature. Main outcome: Aesthetic status, determined by miDFacial symmetry; quantitative smile excursion; and quality of life (using the FaCE instrument) were measured before and after revision. Results: Patients who underwent gracilis refinement directed at either muscle debulking, or gracilis tightening or loosening experienced significantly improved aesthetics/miDFacial symmetry and improved quality of life with no significant decrease in smile excursion. Conclusions: Improved aesthetics and quality of life can be achieved through targeted revision of the gracilis free tissue transfer, without significant loss of smile excursion.},

The authors describe their early experience with five-to-seven nerve transfer, reporting function and patient-reported outcomes, to identify potential parameters that are predictive of outcome. Methods: The authors conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent five-to-seven nerve transfer for smile reanimation from 2012 to 2017. Age, sex, cause of facial paralysis, onset and duration of paralysis, history of adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, donor nerve used, adjunctive procedures, and final excursion were recorded. Standard photographs and videos, and data regarding clinical facial nerve function and patient-reported quality of life, were obtained preoperatively and postoperatively. Results: Sixty patients were identified. Forty-seven had flaccid facial paralysis and 13 had postparalysis facial palsy. Among flaccid facial paralysis patients, masseteric nerve transfer was successful in 30 patients (88 percent) and deep temporal nerve transfer was successful in three cases (60 percent). Among postparalysis facial palsy patients, five-to-seven nerve transfer was successful in two patients (20 percent). Average quality-of-life scores improved significantly from preoperatively (46) to postoperatively (59) among flaccid facial paralysis patients with successful five-to-seven nerve transfer. Conclusions: Five-to-seven nerve transfer is a viable option in facial reanimation. Shorter denervation times and preoperative flaccidity are favorable predictors of outcome. Five-to-seven nerve transfer as an adjunct to primary repair appears highly effective for enhancing smile function. Five-to-seven nerve transfer results are not reliable in patients with postparalysis facial palsy. Clinical question/level of evidence: Therapeutic, IV.},

	title = {Temporal galeal fascia cover of custom-made gold lid weights for correction of paralytic lagophthalmos: long-term evaluation of an improved technique},
	abstract = {Background: Chronic paralytic lagophthalmos is a condition that is often conservatively treated with ophthalmic ointments and eye drops, but usually requires definitive surgical correction. Purpose: An effective modification of the gold lid loading technique is described, which we have found to be the simplest and most reliable method for lid reanimation. Material: After empiric evaluations with lead fisherman's weights 'glued' to the eyelid, a custom-made gold lid weight is made by a jeweller on the basis of the tarsal dimensions of the individual patient, and then sutured to the tarsus under local anaesthesia and covered with a fine sheet of temporal galea. Other ancillary procedures (lower lid suspension, lateral tarsal strip, lateral tarsoplasty) are added as required. Methods: Between 1990 and 1996, 27 patients underwent this type of surgery, of whom 24 were re-evaluated after a mean follow-up period of 73.2 months (range 36-96 months), 14 of these for a minimum of 5 years. Results: None of the gold weights was extruded, all 24 patients experienced marked improvement of their dry-eye symptoms and expressed a high degree of satisfaction. Six patients underwent further minor surgery (lateral McLaughlin tarsorrhaphy) in order to improve relative underaction. Two patients had ptosis (less than 2 mm of asymmetry) of the affected side but refused further correction. Conclusion: The use of custom-made gold lid weights and a protective galeal layer is a simple, reliable and successful means for permanently rehabilitating paralysed eyelids.},

	abstract = {Importance: Though anecdotally linked, few studies have investigated the impact of facial paralysis on depression and quality of life (QOL). Objective: To measure the association between depression, QOL, and facial paralysis in patients seeking treatment at a facial plastic surgery clinic. Design, setting, participants: Data were prospectively collected for patients with all-cause facial paralysis and control patients initially presenting to a facial plastic surgery clinic from 2013 to 2015. The control group included a heterogeneous patient population presenting to facial plastic surgery clinic for evaluation. Patients who had prior facial reanimation surgery or missing demographic and psychometric data were excluded from analysis. Main outcomes and measures: Demographics, facial paralysis etiology, facial paralysis severity (graded on the House-Brackmann scale), Beck depression inventory, and QOL scores in both groups were examined. Potential confounders, including self-reported attractiveness and mood, were collected and analyzed. Self-reported scores were measured using a 0 to 100 visual analog scale. Results: There was a total of 263 patients (mean age, 48.8 years; 66.9\% were female) were analyzed. There were 175 control patients and 88 patients with facial paralysis. Sex distributions were not significantly different between the facial paralysis and control groups. Patients with facial paralysis had significantly higher depression, lower self-reported attractiveness, lower mood, and lower QOL scores. Overall, 37 patients with facial paralysis (42.1\%) screened positive for depression, with the greatest likelihood in patients with House-Brackmann grade 3 or greater (odds ratio, 10.8; 95\% CI, 5.13-22.75) compared with 13 control patients (8.1\%) (P {\textless} .001). In multivariate regression, facial paralysis and female sex were significantly associated with higher depression scores (constant, 2.08 [95\% CI, 0.77-3.39]; facial paralysis effect, 5.98 [95\% CI, 4.38-7.58]; female effect, 1.95 [95\% CI, 0.65-3.25]). Facial paralysis was associated with lower QOL scores (constant, 81.62 [95\% CI, 78.98-84.25]; facial paralysis effect, -16.06 [95\% CI, -20.50 to -11.62]). Conclusions and relevance: For treatment-seeking patients, facial paralysis was significantly associated with increased depression and worse QOL scores. In addition, female sex was significantly associated with increased depression scores. Moreover, patients with a greater severity of facial paralysis were more likely to screen positive for depression. Clinicians initially evaluating patients should consider the psychological impact of facial paralysis to optimize care. Level of evidence: 2.},

Describe the selective use of a partial spinal accessory-facial nerve anastomosis and highlight cases when this may be a useful alternative. Describe the modifications of decompression of the facial nerve for tension-free anastomosis and the use of the muscle pedicle for repair of cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Study design: Report of three cases and a review of the literature. Methods: Charts were reviewed and indications for the procedure were analyzed. The degree of facial movement was recorded as well as the resolution of any cerebrospinal fluid leak. Results: The results varied between Class III and Class IV on the House-Brackmann scale following initial complete paralysis. In the two cases in which spinal fluid leakage had occurred before surgery the leakage was resolved. No donor site morbidity was noted. Conclusions: The potential of low morbidity associated with the use of the sternocleidomastoid branch, along with the potential for delivering a vascularized muscle pedicle to the temporal bone region, makes selective use of this procedure a valuable addition to the multiple reconstruction options for the paralyzed face.},

These fibres were then passed to the Orbicularis Oculi and Oris to aid in reanimation and to improve their tone. The procedure is less extensive, provides a direct line of pull with good functional results, no muscle atropy since vascularity and innervation is maintained.

The objective of this study is to present results of immediate reconstruction of facial nerve in total parotidectomy cases where facial nerve is sacrificed. Methods: This is a prospective study done in patients who had total parotidectomy including facial nerve and immediate reconstruction was done with inter-positional nerve grafts (sural n=12 and greater auricular n=10) from December 2017 till February 2018 by single surgeon (MR). Wounds were closed primarily (n=15), local flap (n=2) and free flap (n=5). Clinical evaluation was done at four months minimum follow up (those operated in January to February 2018) and eight months maximum follow up (those operated in December 2017), for facial nerve functional recovery using House and Brackmann grading system by single author (MR). Results: Total of 22 (male n=7, female n=15) patients included in study from December 2017 till February 2018. Sural nerve grafts were used in 54\% (n=12) and greater auricular nerve grafts in 45\% (n=10) patients for reconstruction of facial nerve. On clinical evaluation using House and Brackmann grading system, showed grade V (n=4), grade IV (n=7), grade III (n=8) and grade II (n=3) repairs. Conclusions: Although primary end to end facial nerve repair is ideal but in situation where a significant segment of nerve is lost or where the repair is under tension, inter-positional nerve grafting is a simple and reliable reconstructive technique with good outcomes.},

	abstract = {Aim of the study: Share our experience and our results of lengthening temporalis myoplasty (LTM) for facial palsy reanimation after parotid surgery. Materials and methods: Study of 15 patients after they had had a lengthening temporalis myoplasty, in the same time or after a non conservative parotidectomy of facial nerve. 10 patients suffered from a parotid malignant tumor, one had a jugal epidermoid skin carcinoma invading the parotid, 2 patients had a facial palsy after removal of pleomorphic adenoma recurrence and two patients had a facial nerve schwannoma. 8 patients had a LTM surgery in the same time of the parotid tumoral removal. Results: No recurrence was observed on the 11 patients who had a carcinoma (average follow up: 27 months). The LTM surgery enabled us to obtain good results at rest for 14 patients (93\%) and an intermediate result for one person. The ability to smile was described as good for 10 patients (66.6\%), intermediate for 4 of them (26.6\%) and unsatisfying for 1 person (6,6\%). In the group rehabilitation, the results observed are similar, for the patients who had one or two surgical steps. In 3 cases, we noticed an infectious complication, which led us to operate again. In the 8 cases within lengthening was performed in the same time as parotidectomy, there was no additionnal surgical difficulty. Conclusion: LTM surgery is an efficient method of rehabilitation. If possible, it should be performed in the same time as tumor removal. As the operational places are different, tumor checking-up and observation are not disturbed by this kind of rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {Over the last two decades, the senior author (B.H.) has had an extensive experience with facial paralysis reconstruction. During this period, the techniques have evolved substantially based on the experience and after observing and analyzing the surgical outcomes. The purpose of this article is to relay the lessons learned from the 20 years' experience and suggest an algorithm. In this retrospective study, we have included 343 cases of facial paralysis cases. Complete facial paralysis cases were 285 and 58 were incomplete facial paralyses, both requiring surgical procedures. Complete facial paralyses were divided in to short term (n = 83) and long term (n = 202). In total, 58\% of the patients were women and 42\% were men. The age range was 6 to 82 years. The techniques employed were direct suture, nerve grafts, cross-facial nerve grafts (CFNGs), masseteric-to-facial nerve transference, hypoglossal-to-facial nerve transference, free muscle transplants, and lengthening temporal myoplasty to achieve the best symmetry after reanimation of unilateral, bilateral, complete, and incomplete facial paralysis. The type of paralysis, objective measurements, the personal patient's smile, and the gender are key concepts to be considered before scheduling a dynamic facial paralysis reconstruction. For unilateral facial paralysis, the time of onset, the type of paralysis, the patient's comorbidities, and the healthy side status are some of the determining factors when selecting the correct technique. The preferred techniques for unilateral facial paralysis are direct repair, CFNG, masseteric-to-facial transposition, and free gracilis transfer. For incomplete facial paralysis, the masseteric-to-facial nerve transference is preferred. In bilateral facial paralysis, bilateral free gracilis transfer is performed in two stages using the nerve of the masseter muscle as the source of innervation. The authors provide an algorithm which simplifies facial paralysis reconstruction to achieve the greatest facial symmetry while thinking about the potential comorbidities and developing spontaneity smile according to the gender of the patient.},

Herein, we studied smile outcomes of a TTT technique via a single intraoral incision without external skin incisions. Objective: To measure the difference in static perioral positions before and after intraoral TTT. Methods: Five patients underwent an externally scarless TTT technique via an intraoral approach. Iris measurements were used to estimate pixel-to-millimeter conversion for facial analysis of vertical and horizontal oral commissure excursion vectors using the JAVA-based program Facegram version 1.0 (Massachusetts Eye \& Ear Infirmary). Results: After surgery, mean vertical height on the affected side significantly increased from 3.4 mm to a postoperative value of 20.6 mm, p = 0.016. There was no difference in horizontal smile excursion after surgery (35.7 mm vs. 32.2 mm, p = 0.37). Smile angle difference between affected and healthy smile (≈í√Æ≈í¬±) reduced from 27.0¬¨‚àû preoperative to 3.5¬¨‚àû, representing a decrease in facial asymmetry (p = 0.002). Conclusion: Intraoral, externally scarless TTT is an effective option for dynamic facial reanimation, obviating external incisions in select patients.},

Twenty-four subjects with a peripheral facial nerve palsy with a median duration of three years were enrolled. We studied activations of four facial muscles with electrical stimulation using surface electrodes. In subjects whose voluntary movement was severely impaired or completely absent, the electrical stimulation produced a movement that was greater in amplitude compared with the voluntary effort in 10 out of 18 subjects in the frontalis muscle, in 5 out of 14 subjects in the zygomaticus major muscle, and in 3 out of 8 subjects in the orbicularis oris muscle. The electrical stimulation produced a stronger blink in 8 subjects out of 22 compared with their spontaneous blinks. The stimulation could produce a better movement even in cases where the muscles were clinically completely paretic, sometimes also in palsies that were several years old, provided that the muscle was not totally denervated.

These cases were retrospectively studied to review technique and to determine outcomes including time to muscle reinnervation, patient satisfaction, smile symmetry, and complications. The mean age was 33 years. Five patients had complete unilateral facial paralysis and one had incomplete. There was no flap loss. The transferred muscle demonstrated active contraction in all patients at a mean of 14 weeks postoperatively (range, 12 to 16 weeks). Good dynamic symmetry was achieved by 6 to 9 months in all patients. All patients underwent rehabilitation including nerve reeducation. No clinically significant pulmonary morbidity was observed after the unilateral transection of the phrenic nerve. Using the phrenic nerve in free muscle transfer for facial paralysis allows a single-stage procedure with no requirement for nerve grafting and a rapid reinnervation time, shortening the time required for restoring facial animation.},

The evaluation was scored by the number of maxillary teeth exposed when smiling with teeth showing. Reliability of this technique was assessed by using 3 independent examiners who each evaluated the smiles of 34 unilateral facial paralysis patients 4 times, creating 408 sets of measurements. Results: The intraclass correlation coefficients for interrater and intrarater reliability exceeded 0.94, which is considered as excellent and reliable.

	abstract = {Introduction: The facial paralysis is a non-rare condition that has very disabling functional, morphological and psychological repercussions. The current gold standard in facial reanimation is revascularized re-innervated muscle transfers. Materials and methods: In this paper, we report the results of a new method using the gracilis flap with a double innervation on the masseter motor nerve and the controlateral facial nerve via a sural graft in a single stage intervention, on a series of six patients. Results: No failure was observed. The average delay of a voluntary contraction was 3.8months, and 7.2months for a spontaneous one. Three of the six patients had "excellent" results according to the Terzis and Noah classification, two were classified as "good" and one "average". Discussion: A choice is to be made between a method advocating a natural and spontaneous dynamicity (controlateral facial nerve stimulus) and a method focusing on the quality and quantity of contractions (ipsilateral trijeminal stimulus). In this new technique, we combine the two methods: a free gracilis transfer with a dual innervation on the healthy controlateral facial nerve via a sural graft, on one hand, and a second anastomosis on the ipsilateral masseter nerve, on the other hand. Conclusion: This new proposed method seems to be, according to our results, a reliable technique rallying voluntary contraction and emotional smile.},

	abstract = {Background: Unilateral established or congenital facial palsies are usually treated with neuromuscular transplantation to reanimate the impaired side of the face. One of the most debated points is the motor nerve to choose for the reinnervation of the transplant. Contra-lateral healthy facial nerve is usually preferred, but in selected cases motor nerve to masseter is considered a valuable option. However only a few clinical studies focused on quality of life in this subset of patients are available in literature. Methods: Twenty patients treated for established or congenital unilateral facial palsy reanimated with gracilis muscle transplant reinnervated with masseteric nerve were retrospectively analyzed. The FDI questionnaire on quality of life was administered before and after surgery and statistical analysis of results was conducted to score changes. Results: Overall results of the questionnaire resulted in a statistically significant improvement after surgery, with a p value of 0.05. Conclusion: Facial animation with gracilis muscle transplant re-innervated with masseteric nerve is a safe and reliable procedure in selected unilateral facial palsy patients. Results reported here confirm that surgery mainly improves the functional aspects of a patient's daily life quality, while the impact on social interactions and self-perception is less significant. The comparison of these results with those obtained in patients treated with gracilis muscle transplant re-innervated via contralateral facial nerve suggests that spontaneity is probably highly relevant to improve social aspects of QOL in this subset of patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Functional free muscle transfer for the surgical correction of long-standing facial paralysis has gained validity over the past three decades. These traditionally multistep reconstructions often achieve clinical success, but at the cost of significant morbidity and lengthy recovery periods. To address this dilemma, the authors propose reconstruction using the rectus abdominis and accompanying intercostal nerve in a one-stage neurovascular free flap reanimation procedure. Methods: Between 1998 and 2001, five patients with long-standing unilateral facial paralysis at the University of Pittsburgh Facial Nerve Center underwent reanimation using the authors' protocol. Preoperative and postoperative assessments included clinical evaluation using the Facial Grading System and electromyography. The patients were followed for a mean of 16 months. Results: At the final postoperative visit, all five patients demonstrated improved levator electromyographic potential, with a median 67 percent improvement. All five patients further demonstrated an increase in zygomaticus electromyographic potential, with a median 225 percent improvement. All five patients demonstrated increased Facial Grading System score at most recent follow-up. Conclusions: The one-step reanimation using free rectus abdominis neurovascular free flap demonstrated a consistent positive outcome in electromyographic and clinical assessments. The additional benefits of reduced recovery time and anatomical reliability of the flap render the authors' method preferable to other traditional methods of surgical reanimation of the paralyzed face.},

	abstract = {Background: This report addresses the efficiency of masseter-to-facial nerve transfer and investigates the patient's ability to perform the functions of eyelid closure and smile movements independently. Methods: From November 2010 to January 2012, seven patients underwent the reported procedure and were followed 6 to 12 months postoperatively. The patients' ages varied from 22 to 41 years. The etiology of the injuries was resection of cerebellopontine angle tumors in all the patients. Using Terzis' and Mehta's scale, smile outcomes and synkinetic movements were evaluated pre- and post-operatively. The function of eyelid closure was evaluated by measuring the width of the lagophthalmos. A questionnaire was applied to evaluate ocular problems and donor-site morbidity. Results: All the patients were able to close their eyelids and smile with biting. Four of the seven patients were able to smile effortlessly without biting. According to Terzis' scale, the postoperative mean score was 4.3 ¬¨¬± 0.8 compared with 1.0 ¬¨¬± 0.0 at the preoperative evaluation. The improvement in the lagophthalmos varied from 2 to 5 mm. The ocular problems all were resolved. All the patients were able to smile easily without eyelid closure and could close their eyes with minimal oral commissure movement. No patients reported weakness of mastication on the affected side, and only minimal atrophy of the masseter muscle at the donor site was noted. Conclusions: Masseter-to-facial nerve transfer is a highly efficient technique for reanimating paralyzed muscle. After physical training, both eyelid closure and smiling are restored and discriminated after physical training.

	abstract = {Importance: Surgeons have sought to optimize outcomes of smile reanimation surgery by combining inputs from nerve-to-masseter and cross-face nerve grafts. An objective assessment tool could help surgeons evaluate outcomes to determine the optimal neural sources for smile reanimation. Objective: To evaluate the use of a novel video time-stamping method and standard outcome measurement tools to assess outcomes of facial reanimation surgery using various innervation strategies. Design, setting, and participants: Cohort study assessing the outcomes of dually innervated gracilis free muscle transfers vs single-source innervated gracilis transfer performed at a tertiary care facial nerve center between 2007 and 2017 using a novel, video time-stamping spontaneity assessment method. The statistical analyses were performed in 2018. Interventions: Dually innervated gracilis free muscle transfers or single-source innervated gracilis transfer. Main outcomes and measures: Spontaneous smiling was assessed by clinicians and quantified using blinded time-stamped video recordings of smiling elicited while viewing humorous video clips. Results: This retrospective cohort study included 25 patients (12 men and 13 women; median [range] age, 38.4 [29.3-46.0] years) treated with dually innervated gracilis free functional muscle graft for unilateral facial palsy between 2007 and 2017. Smile spontaneity assessment was performed in 17 patients and was compared with assessment performed in 24 patients treated with single-source innervated gracilis transfer (ie, nerve-to-masseter-driven or cross-face nerve graft-driven gracilis [n = 13]) (demographic data not available for NTM and CFNG cohorts). The use of time-stamped video assessment revealed that spontaneous synchronous oral commissure movement in a median percentage of smiles was 33\% in patients with dually innervated gracilis (interquartile range [IQR], 0\%-71\%), 20\% of smiles in patients with nerve-to-masseter-driven gracilis (IQR, 0\%-50\%), and 75\% of smiles in patients with cross-face nerve graft-driven gracilis (IQR, 0\%-100\%). Clinicians graded smile spontaneity in dually innervated cases as absent in 40\% (n = 6 of 15), trace in 33\% (n = 5 of 15) and present in 27\% (n = 4 of 15). No association was demonstrated between clinician-reported spontaneity and objectively measured synchronicity. Conclusions and relevance: Dually innervated gracilis free muscle transfers may improve smile spontaneity compared with masseteric nerve-driven transfers but not to the level of cross-face nerve graft-driven gracilis transfers. Quantifying spontaneity is notoriously difficult, and most authors rely on clinical assessment. Our results suggest that clinicians may rate presence of spontaneity higher than objective measures, highlighting the importance of standardized assessment techniques. Level of evidence: 4.},

	abstract = {Introduction and objectives: Micro-neurovascular free muscle flap transfer is currently the procedure of choice for long-standing facial paralysis. We present a case series of patients treated with gracilis muscle free flap with motor innervation by the masseteric nerve. We discuss the surgical technique and quantify the movement granted by the muscle, the improvement in quality of life and aesthetic results. Materials and methods: We report ten patients with unilateral facial paralysis who underwent free gracilis muscle flap, between the years 2010 and 2012 in two tertiary hospitals. Results: It is not reported any failure of the microsuture with survival of all flaps. The muscle movement was quantified by vectors at rest and contraction with an average of 1.7 cm that initiated around the fourth month after surgery. Patients also reported a significant improvement in symmetry at rest as well as oral and ocular competition. Conclusion: As currently presented in literature, microvascular free flaps are the technique of choice for facial reanimation. In our experience, we believe that gracilis muscle flap innervated by the masseteric nerve is a reliable and secure technique that provides adequate functional and aesthetic results.},

	abstract = {Background: Longstanding unilateral facial paralysis is best addressed with microneurovascular muscle transplantation. Neurotization can be obtained from the cross-facial or the masseter nerve. The authors present a quantitative comparison of both procedures using the FACIAL CLIMA system. Methods: Forty-seven patients with complete unilateral facial paralysis underwent reanimation with a free gracilis transplant neurotized to either a cross-facial nerve graft (group I, n=20) or to the ipsilateral masseteric nerve (group II, n=27). Commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity were measured using the FACIAL CLIMA system. Postoperative intragroup commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity means of the reanimated versus the normal side were first compared using the independent samples t test. Mean percentage of recovery of both parameters were compared between the groups using the independent samples t test. Results: Significant differences of mean commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity between the reanimated side and the normal side were observed in group I (p=0.001 and p=0.014, respectively) but not in group II. Intergroup comparisons showed that both commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity were higher in group II, with significant differences for commissural displacement (p=0.048). Mean percentage of recovery of both parameters was higher in group II, with significant differences for commissural displacement (p=0.042). Conclusions: Free gracilis muscle transfer neurotized by the masseteric nerve is a reliable technique for reanimation of longstanding facial paralysis. Compared with cross-facial nerve graft neurotization, this technique provides better symmetry and a higher degree of recovery. Clinical question/level of evidence: Therapeutic, III.},

	abstract = {Background: The microneurovascular transfer of a free-muscle transplant is the procedure of choice for facial animation, It is characterized by low morbidity in both adult and paediatric patients. In spite of the improvements in microsurgical techniques, failures due to absent revascularization or reinnervation of the transplanted muscle or infections causing flap necrosis are observed. We propose a second surgical procedure based on the gracilis muscle transplant reinnervated by the masseteric nerve as a solution for these cases. Methods: We analyzed and report on two patients treated in our department after the failure of a previous cross-facial nerve graft and free muscle transplant. They were treated with a new facial reanimation using the contralateral gracilis muscle and the masseteric nerve as the donor nerve. Results and discussion: We did not observe any postoperative complications, and all of the flaps survived. Reinnervation and contraction of the muscle appeared 3-4 months postoperatively, with good functional and aesthetic results. Conclusions: This technique is a one-step procedure characterized by reliable flap harvesting, low donor site morbidity and good activity of the masseteric nerve. We consider it as a good option for treatment of facial animation failures.},

	title = {Analysis of the ideal muscle weight of gracilis muscle transplants for facial reanimation surgery with regard to the donor nerve and outcome},
	abstract = {Background: Free functional muscle transfers represent the 'criterion standard' for smile reconstruction in facial paralysis. The gracilis muscle is a common donor muscle; however, no data exist regarding the volume of the muscle tissue that is necessary for symmetric commissure excursion. Methods: All patients with facial paralysis receiving a free functional muscle transfer for facial reanimation surgery between January 2009 and November 2015 were retrospectively analysed. Only patients with unilateral facial paralysis and documented weight of the muscle portion were included. The extent of oral commissure amplitude was determined from standardised photographs. Results: In total, 42 free functional gracilis transfers were performed during the study period, of which 22 met the inclusion criteria. Eight muscles were innervated by a cross-facial nerve graft (CFNG) and 14 by the masseteric nerve. Segments between 19 and 50 g of weight (mean: CFNG, 33.9 g and masseteric nerve, 31.7 g; p = 0.59) were transferred. Coaptation to the masseteric nerve led to increased commissure excursion compared to coaptation to the CFNG. We observed a significant increase in commissure excursion with increasing muscle weight in the masseteric nerve group. In this group, four patients underwent secondary flap debulking in flaps weighing ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö¬¢‚Äö√Ñ¬¢27 g. In the CFNG group, only one patient, who had an initial flap weight of 50 g, underwent secondary flap reduction. Thinning reduced the oral commissure movement but improved the symmetry of commissure excursion and the aesthetic result. Conclusion: The ideal muscle weight depends on the donor nerve and should be smaller for masseteric nerve than for CFNG coaptation in adults.},

	title = {Masseteric-facial nerve anastomosis for early facial reanimation},
	abstract = {Objective: Early repair of facial nerve paralysis when cortical neural input cannot be provided by the facial nerve nucleus, is generally accomplished anastomozing the extracranial stump of the facial nerve to a motor donor nerve. That is generally the hypoglossus, which carries a variable degree of morbidity. The present work aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the masseteric nerve as donor for early facial reanimation, with the advantage that harvesting is associated with negligible morbidity. Methods: Between October 2007 and August 2009, 7 patients (2 males, 5 women) with unilateral facial paralysis underwent a masseter-facial nerves anastomosis with an interpositional nerve graft of the great auricular nerve. The interval between the onset of paralysis and surgery ranged from 8 to 48 months (mean 19.2 months). All patients included in the study had signs of facial mimetic muscle fibrillations on electromyography. The degree of preoperative facial nerve dysfunction was grade VI following the House-Brackmann scale for all patients. Results: At the time of the study, all the patients with a minimum follow-up time of 12 months after the onset of mimetic function had recovered facial animation. Facial muscles showed signs of recovery within 2-9 months, mean 4.8 months, with the restoration of facial symmetry at rest. Facial movements appeared while the patients activated their chewing musculature. Morbidity related to this intervention is only the loss of sensitivity of earlobe and preauricular region. Conclusion: The present technique seems to be a valid alternative to classical hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis because of similar facial nerve recovery and lower morbidity.},

	abstract = {Importance: Facial reanimation procedures share the same surgical field as a parotidectomy and are most easily accomplished at the time of facial nerve sacrifice. Early reanimation would also reduce the duration of paralysis and may lead to better functional outcomes. Objective: To assess the incidence and types of facial nerve reanimation performed concurrently with total parotidectomy and facial nerve sacrifice using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (ACS-NSQIP) database. Design, setting, and participants: This cross-sectional study identified 285 patients who underwent total parotidectomy with facial nerve sacrifice (Current Procedural Terminology code 42425) and evaluated the various types of facial reanimation procedures performed concurrently. Patients were identified from the ACS-NSQIP database encompassing 603 community and academic hospitals and underwent treatment from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2015. Data were analyzed from September 20, 2017, through February 21, 2018. Main outcomes and measures: Comparison of demographics in nonreanimation and reanimation groups and subgroups of nerve- and sling-type reanimation procedures. Results: Of 285 patients who underwent total parotidectomy with facial nerve sacrifice (61.8\% men; mean [SD] age, 64 [15] years), 89 (31.2\%; 95\% CI, 26.0\%-37.0\%) underwent at least 1 concurrent facial reanimation procedure. Of the facial nerve procedures performed, 41 (46.1\%; 95\% CI, 36.0\%-56.0\%) were nerve-type repairs, 31 (34.8\%; 95\% CI, 26.0\%-45.0\%) were sling-type repairs, and 17 (19.1\%; 95\% CI, 12.0\%-29.0\%) included both types. Patients treated with nerve-type repairs only were significantly younger than those treated with sling-type repairs only (mean [SD] age, 57.6 [16.0] vs 72.1 [13.8] years; P {\textless} .001). Forty-nine patients underwent free tissue reconstruction. Of those, 24 patients (49.0\%) had concurrent facial reanimation procedure(s) performed; this proportion was significantly more than those who did not undergo free tissue reconstruction (65 of 236 [28.0\%]; P = .003). Conclusions and relevance: In patients undergoing total parotidectomy with facial nerve sacrifice, many are not receiving a concurrent facial reanimation procedure at the time of their tumor resection. Those patients who underwent free tissue reconstruction were significantly more likely to receive a concurrent facial reanimation procedure. These findings may reveal an opportunity for earlier facial reanimation in this patient population. Level of evidence: NA.},

	abstract = {A survey on the feasibility of surface electromyography (EMG) measurements in facial pacing is presented. Pacing for unilateral facial paralysis consists of the measurement of activity from the healthy side of the face and functional electrical stimulation to reanimate the paralyzed one. The goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of surface EMG as a measurement method to detect muscle activations and to determine their intensities. Prior work is discussed, and results from experiments where 12 participants carried out a set of facial movements are presented. EMG was registered from zygomaticus major (smile), orbicularis oris (lip pucker), orbicularis oculi (eye blink), corrugator supercilii (frown), and masseter (chew). Most important facial functions that are limited due to the paralysis are blinking, smiling, and puckering. With majority of the participants, crosstalk between the measured EMG channels was found to be acceptably small to be able to pace smiling and puckering based on detecting their contraction intensities from the healthy side. However, pacing blinking based on orbicularis oculi EMG measurement does not seem possible due to crosstalk from other muscles, but the electro-oculographic (EOG) signals that couple to the same measurement channel could help to detect eye blinks and trigger stimuli. Futhermore, masseter greatly disturbs EMG measurement of most facial muscles, which needs to be addressed in the pacing system to avoid falsely interpreting its activity as the activity of another muscle.},

	title = {Recovery of emotional smiling function in free-flap facial reanimation},
	abstract = {Purpose: Long-standing unilateral facial palsy is treated primarily with free-flap surgery using the masseteric or contralateral facial nerve as a motor source. The use of a gracilis muscle flap innervated by the masseteric nerve restores the smiling function, without obtaining spontaneity. Because emotional smiling is an important factor in facial reanimation, the facial nerve must serve as the motor source to achieve this fundamental target. Materials and methods: From October 1998 to October 2009, 50 patients affected by long-standing unilateral facial paralysis underwent single-stage free-flap reanimation procedures to recover smiling function. A latissimus dorsi flap innervated by the contralateral facial nerve was transplanted in 40 patients, and a gracilis muscle flap innervated by the masseteric nerve in 10 patients. All patients underwent a clinical examination that analyzed voluntary and spontaneous smiling. Results: All patients who received a latissimus dorsi flap innervated by the contralateral facial nerve and recovered muscle function (92.5\%) showed voluntary and spontaneous smiling abilities. All patients who received a gracilis free flap innervated by the masseteric nerve recovered function, but only 1 (10\%) showed occasional spontaneous flap activation. During those rare activations, much less movement was visible on the operated side than when the patient was asked to smile voluntarily. Conclusions: The masseteric nerve is a powerful motor source that guarantees free voluntary gracilis muscle activation; however, it does not guarantee any spontaneous smiling. Single-stage procedures that use a latissimus dorsi flap innervated by the contralateral facial nerve have a lower success rate and obtain less movement; however, spontaneous smiling is always observed.},

Study design: Survey of healthy observers' perception of change in facial visage from preoperative to postoperative state. Setting: Academic tertiary referral center. Main outcome measures: Observer graded affect display. Methods: Ninety naive observers completed a survey with pictures of paralyzed faces, smiling and in repose, before and after surgery, as well as normal comparison faces. Observers characterized affect display of each face coded in primary affects from the Derogatis Affects Balance Scale. Results were analyzed with latent class analysis and regression using a three-class model. Results: Preoperatively, paralyzed faces in repose were most likely to be considered negative (56.0\%), then neutral (41.3\%) and positive (2.7\%). In this same cohort of patients in repose, reanimation surgery restored affect display to normal levels: decreasing negative classification (18.9\%) and increasing neutral (53.4\%) and positive (27.7\%) classification. Hypothesis testing revealed no statistically significant differences in the mean classification probabilities for postoperative faces in repose versus normal faces in repose. The same analysis was performed for smiling faces, which showed marked improvement with reanimation surgery: decreasing negative (45.6\%-11.7\%) and increasing positive (26.2\%-60.0\%) classification. Despite this improvement, there were statistically significant differences in classification of postoperative smiling faces versus normal smiling faces. Conclusion: Facial reanimation surgery was associated with normalized affect display for faces in repose and improved affect display for smiling faces. These results provide evidence that facial reanimation improves the facial expression of emotion. Further assessment in additional contexts will help better characterize the ability of facial reanimation to mitigate the psychosocial burden associated with facial paralysis.},

	abstract = {Objective: To assess the safety and efficacy of upper eyelid gold weight implants in managing paralytic lagophthalmos and to compare two surgical techniques for their insertion. Study design: Retrospective case series. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: One hundred four patients had a gold weight implanted for paralytic lagophthalmos between 1982 and 1996 at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney. Each patient had more than 2 years of follow-up of lid load function. Main outcome measures: The effectiveness of gold weights in reanimating eyelid closure, mean duration of gold weight retention, reasons for removal, and complications resulting from a gold weight; these outcomes were also compared using two surgical techniques for gold weight insertion. Results: One hundred three patients maintained corneal integrity. At the time of assessment, 46 patients had had their lid loads removed from their eyelids, and 58 lid loads remained in situ. Of the lid loads that were removed, 78\% were because the facial nerve had recovered. The remaining 22\% were removed because of cosmetic dissatisfaction (7 patients), the lid load becoming too superficial (6 patients), migration (3 patients), partial extrusion (1 patient), and ptosis resulting from too heavy a weight (1 patient). Conclusion: Gold weights are well tolerated and effective in managing paralytic lagophthalmos. An open surgical technique with direct suture fixation of the gold weight to the tarsal plate produced fewer complications than inserting the lid load into a prefashioned tissue pocket in the preseptal space through a small lateral skin incision.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare objectively and subjectively the results after temporalis tendon and microneurovascular transfer for reanimation of the paralysed face. For the objective analysis, measurements of the distances between static and dynamic points in three-dimensional space were performed at rest and during smiling. The patients were assessed subjectively by non-professionals scoring videotapes. The range of motion of the oral commissure on smiling was 1.7 mm (0.8, mean and SE) after tendon and 5.5 mm (1.6) after microneurovascular transfer (P {\textless} 0.05) without showing teeth, and 0.6 mm (1.3) vs 3.6 mm (2.4, ns) with showing teeth. Compared with the healthy side, the excursions reached 6\% (16) after tendon and 71\% (26, P {\textless} 0.05) after microneurovascular transfer for smiling without, and -4\% (14) vs 19\% (14, ns) for smiling with showing teeth, respectively. Virtually no difference was found in the measurements at rest as well as in the subjective evaluation. Swelling of the cheek (28\%) and tethering of the skin (24\%) were shown to be the most disturbing symptoms after microneurovascular transfer. Better excursion and symmetry of the oral commissure were achieved by microneurovascular reconstruction for voluntary smile. However, the aesthetic outcome after microneurovascular transfer is markedly impaired by chronic complications including swelling of the cheek and tethering of the skin, which were not detected by the three-dimensional measurement technique used. We conclude that the aesthetic appearance should be considered equally important as the range of motion in the reanimated face.},

	abstract = {Background: This report describes the results of a surgical procedure for facial reanimation. This single-stage technique involves the orthodromic transfer of only a superficial segment of the temporalis tendon. This is extended with fascia lata to achieve elevation of the oral commissure along the desired vector in the paralysed hemi-face. Methods: A retrospective case note review was performed. Patients' photographs were objectively evaluated with Facial Assessment by Computer Evaluation (FACE) software. Results: Thirty-nine patients underwent the procedure from 2001 to 2011. Median age at the operation was 57.0 years (interquartile range (IQR) 38.2-66.3 years), and median duration of follow-up was 0.9 years (IQR 0.5-1.8 years). All patients achieved early improvements in appearance and function after surgery. Three patients underwent further, minor procedures for aesthetic and functional adjustments around the oral commissure. Complications occurred in three patients: two minor facial haematomas and one thigh wound infection. The surgery did not disturb natural temporalis muscle function. FACE analysis demonstrated that no significant movement of the oral commissure occurred during attempted smiling in the paralysed hemi-face before surgery. However, symmetry was achieved when the healthy and paralysed hemi-faces were compared post-operatively, both in repose and during controlled smiling. Conclusions: This modified, single-stage technique for facial reanimation improves commissure mobilisation and has been objectively shown to restore symmetry of the commissure to the reanimated hemi-face.},

The average follow-up time was 74,5 months. 93.5\% of subjects had operational causes, among which the most widespread was acoustic neuroma (44.9\%). The average time between facial paralysis and implantation was 141,1 days. Implantation was performed 26,6 days on average after acoustic neuroma surgery and 3,2 days on average after temporal zone malignancy surgery. Thirty-eight patients had their implants removed over either complication (n=14) or recovery (n=24).

Despite several strategies for bilateral smile reconstruction that have been advocated, the condition still presents a challenge to the plastic surgeon. The most acceptable method nowadays is bilateral free neurovascularized muscle transfer. The author represents a new method of using a single hypoglossal nerve to supply both free flaps in a M‚àö‚àÇbius patient.

	abstract = {Introduction: Congenital facial paralysis (FP) is present from birth. It can produce major esthetic and functional disorders. It can be from two different etiologies: developmental and acquired. There is no curative treatment for congenital FP and the aim for the plastic surgeon is to restore a smile as symmetrical and as dynamic as possible. For this, two opposite techniques can be used: muscular free flaps and locoregional flaps whose lengthening temporalis myoplasty. Materiel and methods: We report our series of 34 congenital FP patients who were operated by lengthening temporalis myoplasty (LTM). We divided the patients into three categories: acquired FP (11 cases), isolated developmental FP (13 cases), and syndromic developmental FP (10 cases). The evaluation of the smile is based on the quality of the commissural course compared to the healthy side and the spontaneity of it. Results: In the acquired FP group, 100\% obtained a spontaneous smile with a postoperative delay of 9.5 months, 12 of the 13 cases of isolated developmental FP (92.7\%) after 7.3 months postoperatively, and finally, in the 10 cases of syndromic FP, nine (90\%) had a spontaneous smile after 9.7 months. Discussion: Muscular free flaps continue to be the gold standard for the reanimation of smile on the FP. To our knowledge, no articles comparing smile restoration using free flap and smile restoration using LTM exist. A comparison of the success rates from different studies shows that both these techniques yield good results and can be used for smile restoration in FP. This technique is faster and easier than a free flap and has a same result, which is why we consider this technique as a reference on smile reanimation in FP.},

Screenshots showing the best possible smiles were taken from preoperative videos. Screenshots were taken from postoperative videos showing the best combination of a natural smile on the healthy side and a smile with clenched teeth on the paralytic side. Emotrics and Photoshop software were used for computing vertical, horizontal, and overall excursion from facial landmarks. Scaled measurements of improvement in lip excursion and lip angle was evaluated. Symmetry was evaluated by accepting the healthy side as 100 percent, and the paralytic side was calculated as a percentage of the healthy side. Results: Five patients had total facial paralysis and three had facial paresis. Mean postoperative follow-up period was 15.0¬¨¬®¬¨¬±10.2 months.

Vertical excursion changed from preoperative 38.4¬¨¬®¬¨¬±24.6\% to postoperative 89.3¬¨¬®¬¨¬±11.8\%. Overall excursion changed from preoperative 68.4¬¨¬®¬¨¬±19.6\% to postoperative 92.9¬¨¬®¬¨¬±10.4\%. Paralytic side to healthy side mean lip angle changed from 64.7\% preoperative to 95.2\% postoperatively. All changes were statistically significant (p{\textless}0.05). Conclusion: Facial paralysis patients with an asymmetric smile benefit from distal masseter-to-facial nerve transfer and it improves smile excursion dramatically. This effect was especially prominent in the vertical component of the smiling vector.},

	abstract = {Background: Comparison of functional results of lengthening temporalis myoplasty relies in current practice on subjective scales. The goal of this study was to define a simple, reproducible, objective scale validated through a comparison with a subjective scale for smile symmetrization results after temporal muscle myoplasty. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 25 patients having a unilateral facial palsy and rehabilitated with lengthening temporalis myoplasty. Evaluation consisted of objective measures: smile horizontal symmetry between left and right sides, vertical symmetry, and smile width on healthy and paretic sides on preoperative and postoperative photographs. Subjective scales were also used (i.e., a numeric scale and the Terzis and Noah scale) by a jury (four professionals and four nonprofessionals) and the patient himself or herself. Each evaluation was performed in three conditions: at rest, at intermediary smile, and at maximum smile. Results: Comparison of objective measures on the impaired side showed a postoperative improvement in the three conditions evaluation. Reproducibility of the numeric scale was weak for evaluation at rest and fair for maximum smile evaluation (intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.57). The Terzis and Noah scale was not reproducible from one observer to another. At maximum smile, a correlation between smile symmetry in the vertical plane, smile symmetry in the horizontal plane, and professional evaluation with the numeric scale on the one hand and global patient satisfaction on the other hand was observed. Conclusion: Postoperative smile horizontal symmetry between left and right sides, and smile vertical symmetry, are good indicators with which to assess postoperative results of facial palsy rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {The authors report the experience in facial reanimation using free innervated split and segmental latissimus dorsi muscle flap one-stage transfer in 86 patients with longstanding facial palsy. The segmental latissimus dorsi was taken from the distal part of the muscle so that the muscle flap had an ultra-long neurovascular pedicle of 13 to 17.5 cm in length. The muscle flap was made thinner by splitting the segmental muscle. The split segmental muscle flap was transferred to the paralyzed side of the face with its ultra-long neurovascular pedicle passing through a tunnel in the upper lip to the normal side of the face. The neurovascular pedicle of the muscle flap was anastomosed with the facial nerve, artery, and veins, respectively, on the normal side of the face. The operation was designed without the cross-facial nerve graft stage. From 1986 to October of 1997, 86 patients with long-standing facial paralysis were treated in our department. The duration of facial palsy in this series ranged from 1.5 to 51 years. A satisfactory result was obtained in 80 cases, evaluated at 8 months to 2 years postoperatively. The expression movement of the soft tissues of the face can be seen not only over transferred muscle but also on the paralyzed muscle covered by the splitting muscle flap. It is supposed that this is the result of muscle-muscle neurolization. Study of 66 specimens of latissimus dorsi muscle in the cadavers is discussed.},

	abstract = {Objective: To quantify the degree of oral commissure resting tone improvement in patients undergoing masseter to facial nerve transfer. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was completed in a tertiary academic medical practice. Consecutive cases of masseter nerve transfer patients within a patient database were evaluated from 6/2012 to 9/2017. Inclusion criteria were patients {\textgreater}18 years of age, with complete unilateral paralysis, receiving a masseter to facial nerve transfer, with at least 12 months of recovery, and possessing complete pre- and postoperative data. Patients were excluded if a simultaneous adjunctive procedure was performed so that tone could not be attributed to masseter transfer alone. The main outcome measure was the facial asymmetry index (FAI): the measured difference in distance between the medial canthus and oral commissure of the healthy and paralyzed sides. Results: Twenty-nine patients met inclusion and exclusion criteria and were further analyzed for this study. The oral commissure symmetry improved from 4.7 ¬¨¬± 2.8 mm preoperatively to 2.2 ¬¨¬± 2.3 mm postoperatively. In multivariate analysis, the preoperative FAI was the only significant predictive factor for improvement in commissure symmetry at rest (r = 0.589). This suggests that for each 1.0 mm of worse preoperatively oral commissure asymmetry, the improvement postoperatively was 0.6 mm. Age, gender, body mass index, side of paralysis, duration of paralysis, and recipient branch of facial nerve were not significant predictors in a multivariate analysis. Conclusion: Masseter to facial nerve transfer yields an estimated 60\% correction in the oral commissure asymmetry. This estimation may be helpful in determining if adjunctive procedures should be utilized.},

	abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to review the recipient vessels used in our cases of facial reanimation with free functional muscle transfer and to identify patient variables that may predict when the facial vessels are absent. From this we present a protocol for vessel selection in cases when the facial artery and/or vein are absent. Methods: Patients were identified from November 2006 to October 2013. Data was collected on patient demographics, facial palsy aetiology, history of previous facial surgery/trauma and flap/recipient vessels used. A standard operative approach was adopted and performed by a single surgeon. Results: Eighty-seven eligible patients were identified for inclusion amongst which 98 hemifaces were operated upon. The facial artery and vein were the most commonly used recipient vessels (90\% and 83\% of patients, respectively). Commonly used alternative vessels were the transverse facial vein and superficial temporal artery. Those with congenital facial palsy were significantly more likely to lack a suitable facial vein (P=0.03) and those with a history of previous facial surgery or trauma were significantly more likely to have an absent facial artery and vein (P{\textless}0.05). Conclusions: Our algorithm can help to guide vessel selection cases of facial reanimation with free functional muscle transfer. Amongst patients with congenital facial palsy or in those with a previous history of facial surgery or trauma, the facial vessels are more likely to be absent and so the surgeon should then look towards the transverse facial vein and superficial temporal artery as alternative recipient structures.},

	abstract = {Objective: To demonstrate a phenomenon of contralateral reinnervation in facial nerve palsy patients. Methods: Retrospective case review of 9 patients whose facial muscles were electrophysiologically proven to be reinnervated contralaterally. Results: The duration from symptom onset spanned from 3 to 114 months. All subjects had moderate-to-severe facial palsy initially. Contralateral reinnervation was observed in both traumatic and idiopathic causes, also in both complete and incomplete palsies. Cross-innervation is more frequently reported in muscles near the midline; however, this is the first report demonstrating evidence of cross-innervation in muscles far from the midline–the frontalis, the orbicularis oculi, and the zygomaticus. Conclusion: Although contralateral reinnervation after facial nerve palsy is a common observation, it has not gained appropriate attention. Without recognition of this phenomenon, misinterpretation of the electromyography may mislead the proper timing of nerve repair or reanimation procedure. Therefore, routine examination of motor action potential by contralateral stimulation during electromyography, especially in patients with moderate-to-severe palsy, would provide accurate assessment of the injured nerves and would help in appropriate decision making for further treatment.},

To prevent these adverse effects, surgical rehabilitation of eyelid function is the current treatment choice. In the present paper, we present a modification of the technique devised by Nassif to recover lids from long-standing paralysis. In our modification, the upper lid is rehabilitated by a platisma graft innervated by the contralateral facial nerve branches using a cross-face sural nerve graft. The lower lid is pulled upward by a fascia lata string suspension. Fourteen patients with unilateral facial paralysis were operated on consecutively. For each patient, two sets of frontal photographs with open and closed eyes were available, before and after the surgical rehabilitation. On average, eyelid lumen with closed eyes decreased by 2.6 mm (SD 2.4) after surgical rehabilitation (37\% of the initial value). With open eyes, the decrement was 1.5 mm (SD 1.6, 15\%). The modifications were highly significant (p {\textless} 0.01), with very large effect sizes. Reanimation of the paralyzed eye by mean of cross-face nerve graft followed by platisma neurotization can restore natural eyelid closure and blink reflex.},

Seven months later the first signs of reinnervation of the facial muscles were noticed. Two and a half years after surgery, CN VII function was assessed as grade II/III according to the House-Brackmann scale. The authors emphasize the significance of immediate repair of CN VII in modern skull base surgery but also the importance of a patient's self-training to obtain the best functional outcome of the facial reanimation. Reconstruction using the great auricular nerve has two significant advantages: first, the patient avoids further procedures for nerve repair, and second, the harvested nerve is located in direct proximity to the operation area.},

	abstract = {Background: The series presented constitutes the entire experience with adult facial paralysis reanimation by a single surgeon over three decades. This report discusses the different reconstructive strategies used in this sample, focusing on the incidence and outcomes of commonly used revisional and ancillary procedures. Methods: Since 1979, 175 adult cases of facial paralysis underwent facial reanimation surgery performed by the senior author (J.K.T.). The reconstructive strategies varied in accordance with denervation time, cause, and whether the paralysis was complete or partial and unilateral or bilateral. Irrespective of these variables, the number of patients who required secondary surgery totaled 141 of 175 (81 percent). Postrevision videos were available in 122 patients, who constituted the sample evaluated. Four independent observers rated the outcomes of secondary surgery using a five-category scale ranging from poor to excellent. Results: Interrater reliability testing showed Cronbach's alpha values above acceptable limits (alpha {\textgreater} 0.80). The effect of diverse revisional and ancillary interventions was measured computing a mean gain percentage score. Secondary surgery yielded a significant upgrade in symmetry and function, with appreciable improvements in all three facial regions (upper face, 28 to 166 percent gain; miDFace, 33 to 72 percent gain; and lower face, 20 to 127 percent gain). Conclusions: This comprehensive analysis of the entire series of adult reanimation in the authors' center evidences the beneficial effects of revisional and ancillary interventions to augment function and overall symmetry. Inherent in all methods of dynamic reanimation is the need for secondary adjustments, which should be considered in most cases, as they can transform an adequate result into a gratifying outcome.},

	abstract = {Background: Synchronicity of the oral commissure movement of a bilateral smile is a significant goal for reconstruction in facial reanimation and may only be guaranteed with use of the facial nerve as a donor nerve. Yet over the years several studies report some degree of spontaneity in certain patients when using a non-facial donor nerve, which indicates that synchronous initiation of the smile might be achievable with other donor nerves. We designed a prospective cohort study to evaluate whether pre-operative involuntary activation of the masseteric nerve during smile predicts development of a synchronous smile development when using the masseteric nerve for reanimation. Methods: In a prospective cohort study unilateral long-standing facial palsy patients scheduled for dynamic smile reanimation with a free functional muscle transplant using the masseteric nerve as a donor nerve were preoperatively evaluated via EMG for involuntary activation of the masseter muscle upon smiling, which we called coactivation. Postoperatively, six months after noting the first muscle contraction smile synchronicity was evaluated. We analyzed the synchronicity of the bilateral smile development by analyzing slow-motion video sequences of the patients that were taken while the patients were watching funny video sequences. Results were then correlated with the pre-operative EMG. Results: 30 patients were recruited for this prospective study and underwent facial reanimation surgery with a free gracilis transfer innervated by the masseteric nerve. 19 patients demonstrated involuntary coactivation of the masseter muscle upon smiling and 11 did not. Postoperatively all patients could demonstrate a voluntary smile. 94\% of patients who had preoperative coactivation showed a synchronous movement of the oral commissure when smiling. In those patients, that did not show activation of the masseter muscle upon smiling 0\% showed synchronicity. The preoperative coactivation of the masseter muscle is able to predict the outcome regarding synchronicity of the smile with a sensitivity of 99.7\%, a specificity of 88.5\% and 92.5\% positive predictive value and 99.6\% negative predictive value (p {\textless} 0.001 for all). Conclusions: The lack of masseter co-activation with smile predicts a lack of spontaneous involuntary smile after dynamic smile reconstruction using the masseteric nerve.},

	abstract = {The authors describe a case of a shotgun blast injury to the face in which early definitive repair of both facial soft tissues and facial reanimation was accomplished in one stage using a free flap. The trauma occurred 2 days before presentation via a hunting rifle fired at a short range. On examination, a 8 x 5-cm cheek defect was evident, involving the full thickness of the perioral facial mimetic muscles as well. A free latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap was transferred to the defect, with the thoracodorsal nerve coapted to an ipsilateral, severed buccal branch of the facial nerve. Postoperatively, the flap survived completely, with its skin paddle excised subsequently in two stages. Good muscle movement was obtained, providing resting symmetry and a pleasant smile. Other than soft-tissue and bony defects resulting from shotgun injuries, ablation of the facial nerve or facial mimetic muscles may be an important component of the defect that needs further consideration. The authors conclude that the current technique of one-stage, early definitive repair of soft tissues and facial reanimation in such cases of facial shotgun blast injury offers the advantages of achieving both goals with one flap and accomplishing the procedure primarily in one stage.},

Thanks to our cases and a literature review, we suggest an algorithm. Sixty-six patients haven been reviewed. The static and dynamic clinical evaluation have been done thanks to the study of the medical files, photographs and videos samples. The different techniques we have used were: (a) botulinum toxin in the contralateral depressor labii inferioris (DLI) (n=66), contralateral DLI myectomy (n=1); (b) a strip of fascia lata (n=16) either combined with a lengthening temporalis myoplasty (MAT) (n=10) or only realizing a passive suspension thanks to one vector (n=4), or a passive suspension with two strips (n=2); (c) digastric muscle transfer (n=4).

	abstract = {Background: Free muscle transfer for dynamic smile reanimation in facial paralysis is not always predictable with regard to cosmesis. Hospital stays range from 5 to 7 days. Prolonged operative times, longer hospital stays, and excessive cheek bulk are associated with free flap options. Lengthening temporalis myoplasty offers single-stage smile reanimation with theoretical advantages over free tissue transfer. Methods: From 2012 to 2014, 18 lengthening temporalis myoplasties were performed in 14 children for smile reconstruction. A retrospective chart review was completed for demographics, operative times, length of hospital stay, and perioperative complications. Results: Fourteen consecutive patients with complete facial paralysis were included. Four patients underwent single-stage bilateral reconstruction, and 10 underwent unilateral procedures. Diagnoses included M‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√ábius syndrome (n = 5), posterior cranial fossa tumors (n = 4), posttraumatic (n = 2), hemifacial microsomia (n = 1), and idiopathic (n = 2). Average patient age was 10.1 years. Average operative time was 410 minutes (499 minutes for bilateral lengthening temporalis myoplasty and 373 for unilateral lengthening temporalis myoplasty). Average length of stay was 3.3 days (4.75 days for bilateral lengthening temporalis myoplasty and 2.8 for unilateral lengthening temporalis myoplasty). Nine patients required minor revisions. Conclusions: Lengthening temporalis myoplasty is a safe alternative to free tissue transfer for dynamic smile reconstruction in children with facial paralysis. Limited donor-site morbidity, shorter operative times, and shorter hospital stays are some benefits over free flap options. However, revisions are required frequently secondary to tendon avulsions and adhesions. Clinical question/level of evidence: Therapeutic, IV.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The techniques of facial reanimation are continually evolving in search of the ideal method for rehabilitating the paralyzed face. In the past, alternative cranial nerve motor nuclei have been used to power facial musculature. The trigeminal nerve is gaining popularity as a promising nerve to drive facial motion, particularly in the lower face. Objectives: This article describes a low-tension technique of using the transposed facial nerve to the trigeminal nerve (masseteric branch) for facial reanimation. Methods: Six patients over 2.5 years were treated with facial nerve translocation with division at the geniculate and direct neurorrhaphy to the motor branch of the masseter. Patients were evaluated by physical examination, measurement of oral commissure excursion using MEEI FACE-gram software, video assessment, Sunnybrook Facial Grading System, Facial Disability Index, and Facial Clinimetric Evaluation Scale (FaCE). Results: Patients demonstrated early motion within 4 months postoperatively and were placed into facial physical therapy. All demonstrated improvements in oral competence, strong oral commissure excursion with good symmetry, speech improvements, and variable results in facial tone. Synkinesis to the smile antagonists in the lower face was noted and treated with chemodenervation in three of six. No upper division synkinesis was noted. Conclusion: The motor branch of the trigeminal nerve is an effective option for facial reanimation via facial nerve translocation and end-to-end neurorrhaphy. Variable results in facial tone were noted with excellent oral commissure excursion. This procedure is safe in the reoperated mastoid.},

	abstract = {Introduction: For 100 years hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis (HFA) has been a common surgical procedure for reanimation of paralyzed mimic muscles of the face after axotomy of the facial nerve. However, the denervation and subsequent scarred degeneration of the target muscles of the hypoglossal nerve often results in unfavorable late effects for speech and swallowing. Therefore, the ansa cervicalis nervi hypoglossi-facial nerve anastomosis (ACHFA) can be an alternative to avoid such late effects. As a branch of the hypoglossal nerve the ansa cervicalis innervates the infrahyoidal muscles. Neck dissection surgery proved that resection of the ansa cervicalis causes no side effects for swallowing because of several nerve anastomoses to the cervical plexus. Patients and method: We compared our clinical results of eight cases following a delayed ACHFA with our own experiences after HFA and results from the literature. Results: We found a reanimation rate lower than usually seen after HFA only in the target muscles of the forehead. This may be caused by a reduced neuronal plasticity of the ansa cervicalis. However, in the target muscles of the other two facial nerve branches we observed the same good results one would expect after HFA. There were no late side effects for swallowing and speech though.},

	abstract = {This report describes a new surgical technique to improve the results of conventional hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis that does not necessitate the use of nerve grafts or hemihypoglossal nerve splitting. Using this technique, the mastoid process is partially resected to open the stylomastoid foramen and the descending portion of the facial nerve in the mastoid cavity is exposed by drilling to the level of the external genu and then sectioning its most proximal portion. The hypoglossal nerve beneath the internal jugular vein is exposed at the level of the axis and dissected as proximally as possible. One-half of the hypoglossal nerve is transected: use of less than one-half of the hypoglossal nerve is adequate for approximation to the distal stump of the atrophic facial nerve. The nerve endings, the proximally cut end of the hypoglossal nerve, and the distal stump of the facial nerve are approximated and anastomosed without tension. This technique was used in four patients with long-standing facial paralysis (greater than 24 months), and it provided satisfactory facial reanimation, with no evidence of hemitongue atrophy or dysfunction. Because it completely preserves glossal function, the hemihypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis described here constitutes a successful approach in patients with long-standing facial paralysis who do not wish to have tongue function compromised.},

	abstract = {Objective: To identify early predictors of long-term facial nerve function after vestibular schwannoma resection. Study design: Retrospective chart review. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: Subjects with facial nerve weakness despite anatomic preservation of the nerve after removal of vestibular schwannoma. Intervention: Surgical resection of vestibular schwannoma. Main outcome measure: Facial function after 1 postoperative year. Independent variables included patient demographics, presenting symptoms, tumor size and location, and serial postoperative function within the first year. Results: Among 281 patients with postoperative facial weakness, 81\% improved to a House-Brackmann (HB) III or better (good outcome) after 12 months of recovery, whereas 12\% remained HB IV or worse (poor outcome). For patients starting with HB V or VI function, recovery rate was the most reliable predictor of poor outcome after 1 year. The resulting predictive model using rate of functional improvement as the independent variable was found to anticipate poor outcome before 1 year in more than 50\% of cases with 97\% sensitivity and 97\% specificity. Although associated with facial nerve outcome, tumor size, tumor vascularity, preoperative facial function, age at surgery, and ability to stimulate the nerve intraoperatively did not contribute significantly to the predictive model. Conclusion: The rate of recovery within the first postoperative year serves as a useful early predictor of long-term facial nerve function. We present a novel predictive model using rate of recovery that can be used to select candidates for reanimation surgery sooner than the traditional waiting period of 1 year, potentially improving the outcome of this intervention.},

	abstract = {Importance: Facial nerve paralysis is an unfortunate, yet relatively common sequela in the treatment of head and neck cancer. Static options for reanimation of the paralyzed miDFace and oral commissure offer limited quality-of-life improvement and may stretch over time. Reinnervation offers a prolonged recovery and may not be possible among patients with advanced cancer or in salvage situations. Objective: To determine the improvement in resting tone and dynamic excursion gained by use of temporalis tendon transfer (TTT) and lengthening temporalis myoplasty (LTM) for facial nerve reanimation among patients undergoing oncologic head and neck cancer surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: We present the largest series of primary and secondary TTT operations with prolonged photographic and video-based data with analysis enabled by FaceGram open-source quantitative methodology. This was achieved using preoperative and postoperative digital photographs of each patient at rest and full smile excursion. Using the JAVA-based program Facegram v1.0, measurements were taken of the oral commissure in relation to a line tangent to the inferior border of the lower lip. All operations were performed at the University of California, San Francisco, following oncologic resections between April 2011 and June 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Quantitative analysis of facial measurement with Facegram. Results: Of the 32 patients in our series, 19 (59.4\%) were male and 13 (40.6\%) were female. The average age was 71.3 ¬¨¬± 10 years. There was a mean 4.89 mm (p {\textless} 0.01, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2.78-6.99) increase in height of affected side oral commissure compared with preoperative measurements during full smile excursion, and a 3.05 mm (p {\textless} 0.04, 95\% CI: 0.22-5.87) increase in horizontal excursion of smile vector. There was also a significant increase in static support at rest, measuring an average of 5.45 mm (p {\textless} 0.01, 95\% CI: 2.56-8.33) and 2.71 mm (p {\textless} 0.04, 95\% CI: 0.18-5.25) increase in affected oral commissure vertical and horizontal positions at rest, respectively. The average postoperative follow-up was 11.4 months (95\% CI: 5.6-14.11). In addition, when compared with patients treated with postoperative radiation therapy (9 patients), those who received preoperative radiation (15 patients) had a significant improvement in the resting vertical height of the affected side (mean 5.32 mm (p {\textless} 0.05, 95\% CI: 0.06-10.57)). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings encourage the use of TTT/LTM for facial nerve paralysis in appropriately selected head and neck oncologic patients.},

	abstract = {Objective: To evaluate long-term outcomes of free gracilis muscle transfer (FGMT) for smile reanimation on smile excursion, facial symmetry, and quality of life in a cohort of children with facial palsy. Study design: A retrospective analysis of 40 pediatric patients who underwent FGMT for facial palsy at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Facial Nerve Center was performed. Preoperative and postoperative photography and videography were used to quantify smile excursion and facial symmetry. Preoperative and postoperative quality of life was assessed with the Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE) survey, a validated, patient-based instrument for evaluating facial impairment and disability. Results: Of the 40 patients who underwent FGMT for facial palsy, 38 patients had complete data including preoperative and postoperative photography and videography from 3 months to 10 years following surgery; 13 cases had {\textgreater}5 years of follow-up. FGMT resulted in significant improvements in smile excursion within several months, with continued improvements in smile excursion and symmetry demonstrated more than 5 years later. Fifteen patients completed preoperative and postoperative FaCE surveys, which demonstrated significant improvement in quality of life scores following FGMT. Conclusions: FGMT significantly improves smile, facial asymmetry, and quality of life for years after this surgery for facial palsy.},

	abstract = {Objectives: We describe an approach to reanimation of complete, prolonged facial paralysis using minimally invasive temporalis tendon transfer (MIT3) by the melolabial or transoral approach. Objective outcome measures are evaluated based on symmetry, and grading of preoperative/post-operative results and the scar at the melolabial fold. Study design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: Twenty-five patients undergoing the MIT3 technique were studied. Photographic analysis was used to determine the percentage of difference between the 2 sides (symmetry). Using the Delphi method to achieve consensus, a panel of experts graded pre/post-operative photos using the Terzis' Facial Grading System and a 1 to 10 Likert-type scale and the melolabial scar using the Beausang Scar Scale. Results: Percentage of difference (symmetry) with smiling improved from 18.6\% ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 1.5\% (mean ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± standard error of the mean [SEM]) preoperatively to 5.0 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 0.9\% (mean ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± SEM) post-operatively. Expert grading by the Terzis system showed improvement post-operatively (mean 3.7/5; median 3.6/5) versus preoperatively (mean 1.5/5; median 1.2/5). Perceived improvement was also largely favourable (mean 8.1/10; median 8.0/10). Melolabial scar grading was favourable in terms of colour (mean 1.53/4), surface character (mean 1.05/2), contour (mean 1.60/4), and distortion (mean 1.74/4). Conclusions: The MIT3 technique offers immediate, predictable, and symmetrical return of smile function. Objective symmetry analysis and favourable expert grading of both pre-/post-operative photographs and the scar at the melolabial fold demonstrate applicability for facial reanimation in patients where other procedures have failed, or when a direct return to function is desired. Both the melolabial approach and transoral approach were found to be acceptable and effective, although applicability varies.},

	abstract = {Importance: The hypoglossal nerve has long been an axonal source for reinnervation of the paralyzed face. In this study, we report our experience with transposition of the intratemporal facial nerve to the hypoglossal nerve for facial reanimation. Objectives: To determine the feasibility and outcomes of the transposition of the infratemeporal facial nerve for end-to-side coaptation to the hypoglossal nerve for facial reanimation. Design, settings, and participants: A case series of 20 patients with facial paralysis who underwent mobilization and transposition of the intratemporal segment of the facial nerve for an end-to-side coaptation to the hypoglossal nerve (the VII to XII technique). Participants were treated between January 2007 and December 2014 at a tertiary care center. Main outcomes and measures: Outcome measures include paralysis duration, facial tone, facial symmetry at rest, and with smile, oral commissure excursion, post-reanimation volitional smile, and synkinesis. Methods: Demographic data, the effects of this technique on facial tone, symmetry, oral commissure excursion and smile recovery were evaluated. Preoperative and postoperative photography and videography were reviewed. Facial symmetry was assessed with a facial asymmetry index. Smile outcomes were evaluated with a visual smile recovery scale, and lip excursion was assessed with the MEEI-SMILE system. Results: All 20 patients had adequate length of facial nerve mobilized for direct end-to-side coaptation to the hypoglossal nerve. The median duration of facial paralysis prior to treatment was 11.4 months. Median follow-up time was 29 months. Three patients were excluded from functional analysis due to lack of follow-up. Facial symmetry at rest and during animation improved in 16 of 17 patients. The median (range) time for return of facial muscle tone was 7.3 (2.0-12.0) months. A significant reduction in facial asymmetry index occurred at rest and with movement. The MEEI FACE-gram software detected a significant increase in horizontal, vertical, overall lip excursion and smile angle. No patient developed significant tongue atrophy, impaired tongue mobility, or speech or swallow dysfunction. Conclusions and relevence: Mobilization of the intratemporal segment of the facial nerve provides adequate length for direct end-to-end coaptation to the hypoglossal nerve and is effective in restoring facial tone and symmetry after facial paralysis. The resulting smile is symmetric or nearly symmetric in the majority of patients with varying degree of dental show. The additional length provided by utilizing the intratemporal segment of the facial nerve reduces the deficits associated with complete hypoglossal division/splitting, and avoids the need for interposition grafts and multiple coaptation sites.

	abstract = {Simultaneous dual system rehabilitation of facial paralysis involves using two independent reanimation techniques to optimize facial movement in both a quantitative and qualitative manner. These techniques involve the use of nerve grafting or crossover procedures combined with a dynamic muscle transfer. A group of 37 patients who underwent five different combinations of reanimation was analyzed. The techniques were evaluated using a standard rating scheme for judging success of reanimation procedures. The combination of a masseter muscle transfer to the lower region of the face and a cable graft of the upper facial nerve division appeared to offer excellent results in terms of independent motion of the upper and lower regions of the face and good eye closure, while allowing spontaneous mimetic function in 50\% of cases. The advantages and disadvantages of the other techniques are described. The clinical situations in which these techniques have advantage over single reanimation techniques are outlined.},

	abstract = {Background: For the treatment of facial paralysis, functioning free muscle transplantation has become accepted standard treatment. Choice of donor nerve and number of surgery stages, however, are still matters of great debate. Methods: Between 2000 and 2011, 36 patients (out of 329; 11 percent) with 42 functioning free muscle transplantations were treated using spinal accessory nerve (XI)-innervated muscle for facial reanimation as a one-stage procedure. Indications included bilateral or unilateral M‚àö‚àÇbius syndrome, severe postparetic facial synkinesis, and patient preference. Postoperative smile training was required to achieve spontaneous smile. For outcome assessment, patients were evaluated using multidisciplinary methods, including objective smile excursion score (range, 0 to 4), cortical adaptation stage (range, I to V), tickle test, and subjective patient questionnaire and satisfaction score (range, 1 to 5). Results: Mean smile excursion score improved from 0.5 preoperatively to 3.4 postoperatively. Eighty-three percent of patients were able to perform independent and even spontaneous smile after 1 year of follow-up. Ninety percent of patients had a mean satisfaction score of 3.4 out of 5. However, 50 percent expressed more concern with aesthetic appearance than functional status. There was no functional morbidity of the donor shoulder in daily life. Conclusions: The classic two-stage procedure is still the first choice for facial paralysis reconstruction. However, the effectiveness of XI-innervated free muscle for facial reanimation in a one-stage procedure has proven it to be a good alternative treatment. It has become second in popularity for facial paralysis reconstruction in the authors' center. Clinical question/level of evidence: Therapeutic, IV.},

	abstract = {The aim of the present study was to analyse the consequences of masseter muscle denervation. In facial palsy surgical treatment, the masseteric nerve constitutes an important nerve source for facial reanimation due to its anatomical position and large amount of available axons. Computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging were performed in 30 control subjects, and three radiologists separately measured the longitudinal diameter (LD), anteroposterior diameter (APD), transverse diameter (TD), and skeletal muscle area (SMA) of the masseter muscles as reference values. Regarding the facial palsy group, from 2009 to 2018, 11 patients (4 men and 7 women) were selected on the following inclusion criteria: diagnosis of unilateral facial paralysis, minimum follow-up of 14 months, absence of temporomandibular dysfunction, presence of complete dentition (to minimise bias of stomatognathic evaluation), complete clinical and radiological records. The mean LD, APD, TD, and SMA values of the healthy and denervated masseter muscles were obtained and compared. Stomatognathic function was clinically examined through mean mouth opening (MMO) and Maximum Bite Force (MBF). Furthermore, facial symmetry analysis (FSA) was carried out using EMOTRICS Software. Reference values obtained were as follows: mean LD = 69 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 5.9 mm (range: 59-85 mm); mean APD = 40.2 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 3.3 mm (range: 34-48 mm); mean TD = 15.5 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 3.1 mm (range: 11-26 mm); and mean SMA = 43.8 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 13.5 mm3 (range: 26-85.8 mm3). No statistically significant difference was observed between the healthy facial palsy groups's masseter muscles and reference values. As the latter, in denervated masseter muscles, no statistically significant difference was observed for APD value in contrast to LD, TD and SMA that showed statistically significant difference in comparison with control population (p {\textless} 0.05, CI 95\%). Moreover fibro-adipose degeneration was consistently observed, with its degree being directly proportional to the denervation time. MMO and MBF mean values were, respectively, 54.75 mm in men, 44.4 mm in women and 705N. None of the latter showed a statistically significant difference with respect to the control population and the parameters present in the literature, indicating that masseter-facial neurorrhaphy is a safe and effective procedure for facial reanimation with good functional and aesthetic outcomes.},

	abstract = {Facial nerve repair is a dynamic reanimation technique. Direct nerve repair by suturing or grafting can provide good results within a specific time frame. Immediate nerve repair has been successful in cases of laceration injuries, but nerve grafting techniques are typically delayed when it is clear that direct suturing to the nerve trunk cannot be achieved without tension. Delayed nerve grafting is also employed following ablative procedures and in cases of trauma that cause segmental nerve deficits. Cross-facial nerve grafting is particularly useful when the peripheral branches are intact and the main trunk of the facial nerve is inaccessible. This method is also typically performed in a delayed fashion. Rehabilitation of the facial nerve and subsequent reinnervation of the mimetic motor endplates are achieved through axonal growth. In this article, we describe a consecutive series of five patients who developed facial paralysis following cranial surgery for acoustic neuroma. Each underwent successful cross-facial nerve grafting during the first week following their initial surgery. Each received a sural nerve graft to at least two main divisions of the VIIth cranial nerve. We discuss our operative technique and the degree of restored nerve function.},

The lip reanimation outcome questionnaire is designed to assess these functional impairments after lip reanimation. Study design: Cross-sectional validation study. Setting: Tertiary care academic center. Subjects and methods: Patients who underwent lip reanimation and control subjects. A disease-specific instrument was created by systematic literature review and expert opinion. The 15-item patient completed subscale was administered to 20 lip reanimation patients. Photographs of 19 patients and three control subjects were taken in four poses and rated by six raters (2 surgeons, 2 residents, and 2 novices) by the use of a external rater subscale, and reliability was determined by the use of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Content and construct validity were assessed. Results: Internal consistency (ICC range 0.813-0.915 for each domain), test-retest reliability (ICC range 0.616-0.981 for each item) for the patient completed subscale, and interrater (ICC = 0.852) and interlevel reliability (ICC = 0.929) for the external rater subscale were substantial to excellent. The content validity index was 0.87. Construct validity was demonstrated by poorer scores in patients with transected nerves versus intact nerves for appearance (P = 0.04) and oral competence (P = 0.011). Photographs of control patients had lower asymmetry scores (P {\textless} 0.001), and the instrument detected greater asymmetry in patients with progressively more exaggerated smile (P {\textless} 0.001). Conclusion: The lip reanimation outcome questionnaire has promising reliability and validity in this preliminary study, but additional psychometric testing with larger samples is required before the survey can be recommended for clinical use.},

	title = {Facial nerve repair after operative injury: {Impact} of timing on hypoglossal-facial nerve graft outcomes},
	abstract = {Purpose: Reanimation of facial paralysis is a complex problem with multiple treatment options. One option is hypoglossal-facial nerve grafting, which can be performed in the immediate postoperative period after nerve transection, or in a delayed setting after skull base surgery when the nerve is anatomically intact but function is poor. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of timing of hypoglossal-facial grafting on functional outcome. Materials and methods: A retrospective case series from a single tertiary otologic referral center was performed identifying 60 patients with facial nerve injury following cerebellopontine angle tumor extirpation. Patients underwent hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis following facial nerve injury. Facial nerve function was measured using the House-Brackmann facial nerve grading system at a median follow-up interval of 18months. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used determine how time to hypoglossal-facial nerve grafting affected odds of achieving House-Brackmann grade of ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö¬¢¬¨√ü3. Results: Patients who underwent acute hypoglossal-facial anastomotic repair (0-14days from injury) were more likely to achieve House-Brackmann grade ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö¬¢¬¨√ü3 compared to those that had delayed repair (OR 4.97, 95\% CI 1.5-16.9, p=0.01). Conclusions: Early hypoglossal-facial anastomotic repair after acute facial nerve injury is associated with better long-term facial function outcomes and should be considered in the management algorithm.},

	title = {Quantitative facial motion analysis after functional free muscle reanimation procedures},
	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the success of functional free muscle transfer in patients with chronic facial paralysis using a recently developed quantitative method known as the maximum static response assay of facial motion. A retrospective review of a single surgeon series of six patients with longstanding facial paralysis was performed. The maximum static response assay was performed on all patients preoperatively and serially during the postoperative period. Twenty-seven patients (54 sides) with normal facial function were also evaluated and served as controls. The contralateral normal side in those patients with unilateral facial paralysis (n = 4) also served as a control. Movement of the modiolus during smile was recorded in the x axis and y axis. To determine net smile movement, the vector of movement was calculated by means of the Pythagorean theorem. Vectors were then defined mathematically by calculating direction and magnitude. The average direction of the vector during smile for the normal control population was 58.3 degrees (range 32.5 to 83.1 degrees) from the horizontal through the modioli, and the average magnitude was 10.6 mm (range 4.2 to 20.1 mm). The average preoperative direction for the reanimated sides was 176.8 degrees with a range of 83.3 to 225 degrees. Patients with bilateral paralysis (n = 2) were excluded for calculation of the vectors on the normal contralateral side. The average preoperative direction for the normal contralateral side in patients with facial paralysis was 58.3 degrees with a range of 48.2 to 68.4 degrees. Postoperatively, the average direction of the vector during smile for the reanimated sides improved to a value of 77.6 degrees with a range of 45.7 to 113.8 degrees. The average change in direction of the preoperative reanimated side compared with the postoperative reanimated side was significant (p = 0.01). Postoperatively, the average direction of the vector for the contralateral normal sides was 43 degrees with a range of 11 to 57.2 degrees. The change in direction for the contralateral normal side was not significant (p = 0.18). The average magnitude of the reanimated side improved from a non-anatomic 2.8 mm preoperatively (range 0.8 to 6.8 mm) to an anatomic 4.9 mm postoperatively (p = 0.02). The contralateral normal side magnitude decreased from 9.4 mm (range 7.3 to 11.6 mm) preoperatively to 5.7 mm (range 3.8 to 7.7 mm) postoperatively (p = 0.006). More specifically, the absolute change in movement on the reanimated side during smile for the x axis and y axis was 2.3 mm (p = 0.05) and 4.0 mm (p = 0.002), respectively. This corresponded to an absolute change in the magnitude of the vector of 4.6 mm in an anatomic direction. On the contralateral side the absolute change in magnitude during smile from preoperative to postoperative for the x axis and y axis decreased by 1.5 mm (p = 0.13) and 5.3 mm (p = 0.05), respectively. This reflected an absolute change in the magnitude of the vector of 5.5 mm. Functional free muscle transfer in patients with chronic facial paralysis resulted in anatomic recovery of motion in the majority of patients in this series. The maximum static response assay can be used to objectively assess the results of facial reanimation.},

After wide excision of the tumor, including the facial nerve except the temporal branch and part of the zygomatic major muscle and masseter muscle, the authors reconstructed the cheek skin and provided movement by performing a small-segment latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap transfer using Harii's method and the defect of the buccal and marginal mandibular branches of the facial nerve by funicular grafting from one of the two funicles of the thoracodorsal nerve. After 6 months, the transplanted, small-segment latissimus dorsi muscle showed good voluntary movement, and the lower orbiculus oris and depressor oris presented good functional recovery. The authors believe the two funicles of the thoracodorsal nerve can be used independently for two purposes: one for functional segmental muscle transfer and the other for nerve grafting to defects of branches of the facial nerve. This concept makes it possible to reconstruct multiple facial movements while minimizing donor site morbidity by means of immediate facial reanimation.},

	abstract = {Lagophthalmos is one of the most unpleasant and dangerous conditions that affect patients with facial palsy. The lack of ocular protection leads to corneal problems (such as conjunctival infections, acute and chronic keratitis, corneal ulcerations, and blindness). A dynamic reanimation of blinking eyelids is the therapeutic gold standard. However, success is not guaranteed with these dynamic techniques; even if results are good, blinking is usually restored within a year of the initial operation. Procedures that act more rapidly and have a higher success rate are needed. We proposed that lipofilling of the upper eyelid would improve eye closure, exploit the advantages of using autologous fat, and avoid the risks of exposure or migration associated with loading the lid with gold. Between 2012 and September 2018, we did upper eyelid lipofilling procedures for 75 patients with unilateral facial palsy. The main favourable result of lipofilling of the upper lid was the immediate improvement in corneal discomfort. Everybody described a partial to total increase in corneal comfort postoperatively. In the treatment of paralytic lagophthalmos, lipofilling of the upper eyelid produces favourable aesthetic and functional results, ocular health is restored, and the patients' quality of life is improved.},

Subgroup difference was found to be statistically significant (P = 0.027). The overall prevalence of the bifid ZMj is 22.7\% (95\% CI 14.3\%-34.2\%). This contributes to the understanding of various facial muscle morphologies and attachment patterns, which have significant implications in surgical planning and procedures for facial reanimation and recreation of natural patient appearances.},

In this study, we compared CFNG- and double-innervated free gracilis muscle transfer (FGMT) for facial palsy reconstruction.A total of 49 patients with facial palsy who underwent facial reanimation surgery from August 2013 to January 2017 were enrolled. The CFNG group (18 patients) underwent 2-stage CFNG innervation, whereas the double-innervated FGMT group (31 patients) underwent dual coaptation with end-to-end masseter nerve and end-to-side CFNG. The FACEgram software was used for evaluating smile excursion, symmetry index, spontaneous smile occurrence, Terzis' score including palsy pathogenesis, and clinical progress.In the CFNG group, the smile excursion at rest increased (P = 0.000); however, there was increased smile excursion both at rest and during smiling in the double-innervated FMGT group (rest P = 0.002, smile P = 0.028). Improvement of the symmetry index was observed only in the FMGT group (rest P = 0.001, smile P = 0.000). There was no significant difference in Terzis' scores. The average time to the first visible muscle contracture was statistically significantly shorter in the double-innervated FGMT group (P = 0.035). With respect to spontaneous smile achievement, the double-innervated FGMT group (25.8\%) showed a satisfactory outcome.Cross-face nerve graft-innervated FGMT improved only smile excursion at rest, whereas double-innervated FGMT provided improvement in both the resting and smiling postures. Furthermore, the double-innervated FGMT group showed a higher symmetry index. However, the 2 operations did not show a significant difference in functional aspects.},

	abstract = {Background: Hypoglossal-facial direct side-to-end neurorrhaphy has become widely used for facial reanimation in patients with irreversible facial nerve damage. Although this procedure achieves good restoration of facial function, it has disadvantages such as mass movement and lack of spontaneity. Objective: To present a new facial reanimation technique using hypoglossal-facial direct side-to-end neurorrhaphy with concomitant masseteric-zygomatic nerve branch coaptation and secondary muscle transfer to reduce mass movement and achieve a spontaneous smile in patients with facial paralysis. Methods: This article describes a novel facial reanimation technique that employs hypoglossal and masseteric nerve transfer combined with secondary vascularized functional gracilis muscle transfer. Results: Details of the technique are reported in a patient with complete facial paralysis after brain surgery. The hypoglossal nerve was partially served and connected to the mastoid segment of the facial nerve by side-to-end anastomosis to restore facial symmetry. A nerve supplying the masseter muscle was coapted with a zygomatic branch by end-to-end anastomosis to restore voluntary movement of the oral commissure, as well as to assist with eye closure. A cross face sural nerve graft was connected to zygomatic branches on the healthy side. In the second stage, a vascularized functional gracilis muscle graft was transplanted using the cross face nerve graft as the donor nerve to restore a natural smile. Conclusion: Hypoglossal-facial neurorrhaphy with concomitant masseteric-zygomatic nerve branch coaptation and muscle transfer is an alternative facial reanimation technique that reduces mass movement and achieves a natural smile.},

	abstract = {Background: Facial palsy leads to functional and aesthetic deficits, which impair the quality of life of affected patients. General health-related and disease-specific questionnaires are available for quality of life assessment. In this study, observer-based analysis of facial function (Sunnybrook Facial Grading Scale) was compared patient-based to facial palsy-specific gradings (Facial Clinimetric Evaluation Scale and Facial Disability Index), and general health-related quality of life questionnaires (SF-36). We hypothesized that only facial palsy-specific instruments capture functional and social impairments of affected patients. Methods: Thirty facial palsy patients treated at a tertiary referral centre were included in this study. Inclusion criteria were unilateral facial palsy with stable facial function, age over 18 years and fluency in German. Facial function was assessed with general and disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures and subsequently evaluated by the treating facial plastic surgeon. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics for all assessed measurements. Correlations were calculated to compare general and facial palsy-specific instruments, as well as observer-based grading. Results: Observer-based evaluation of facial function correlated well to the patients-based assessment of physical function, however social subscores did not correlate demonstrating the limited correlation of patient distress and facial nerve impairment. Physical function scores of disease-specific instruments did not correlate with general health assessment scores, while social function scores showed moderate to good correlations. Conclusion: Validated disease-specific instruments are essential for the assessment of facial palsy patients. Patient-reported outcome measures like the FaCE Scale and the Facial Disability Index should be applied in addition to standardized observer-based ratings to capture the patients' perspective on functional and social impairments associated with facial palsy to fully assess the burden of disease.},

We were interested in how motor recovery is associated with cortical reorganization of lip and tongue representation in the primary sensorimotor cortex after the transfer. Therefore, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 13 patients who underwent a hypoglossal-facial transfer after unilateral peripheral facial palsy. To identify primary motor and somatosensory tongue and lip representation sites, we measured repetitive tongue and lip movements during fMRI. Electromyography (EMG) of the perioral muscles during tongue and lip movements and standardized evaluation of lip elevation served as outcome parameters. We found an association of cortical representation sites in the pre- and postcentral gyrus (decreased distance of lip and tongue representation) with symmetry of recovered lip movements (lip elevation) and coactivation of the lip during voluntary tongue movements (EMG-activity of the lip during tongue movements). Overall, our study shows that hypoglossal-facial transfer resulted in an outcome-dependent cortical reorganization with activation of the cortical tongue area for restituded movement of the lip.},

	abstract = {Background: Head and neck arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) involving branches of the facial nerve often cause tremendous cosmetic, functional, and psychological problems that are challenging to treat. We proposed an algorithm to obtain the optimal treatment and esthetic outcome. Methods: Medical records of 24 patients were reviewed between 2002 and 2015. The lesions were classified into 4 types: type 1, involving no more than 2 facial nerve branches, with a maximal diameter of lesion of 5 cm or less (n = 7); type 2, involving no less than 2 facial nerve branches, with a maximal diameter of lesion of greater than 5 cm (type 2a, facial nerve preservation, n = 8; type 2b, facial reanimation, n = 5); and type 3, involving the mastoid segments or the trunk of the facial nerve (n = 4). Treatment efficacy was assessed and facial function was evaluated using the regional House-Brackmann Facial Nerve Grading System. Results: Cure was achieved in 11 (45.8\%) patients, and improvement was achieved in 12 (50.0\%) patients, with a follow-up of 36.3 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 32.9 months (range, 12-144 months). There was no significant difference of the regional House-Brackmann Facial Nerve Grading System score before and after treatment (type 1, unchanged; type 2a, P = 0.356; type 2b, P = 0.423; type 3, unchanged). Treatment outcomes were not significantly related to the type of nerve involvement (P = 1.000) and the facial reanimation procedure (P = 1.000). Conclusions: Surgical excision or ethanol embolization alone is efficient for type 1 AVMs. The optimal approach for type 2a AVMs was surgery, followed by well-vascularized tissue transfer. In type 2b AVMs, the satisfied treatment results are achieved by lesion excision and immediate facial reanimation. A 2-stage strategy may result in contented treatment outcome in type 3 AVMs.},

	abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the expression of p75 nerve growth factor receptor (p75NGFR) in human cross-facial nerve grafts and to compare the immunohistological findings with patient data and the functional outcome in facial reanimation. Materials and methods: The study comprised 37 sural nerve graft specimens. All of the patients had long-lasting complete facial paralysis and were operated on by the standard two-stage procedure involving cross-facial nerve grafts and microneurovascular muscle transfer. Nerve biopsies were taken 4 to 20 months (mean, 8 months) after the cross-facial nerve grafting. Immunohistochemistry for p75NGFR as well as for Schwann cells (S-100; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and for Neurofilament-200 (NF-200; Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) was performed. Results: In graft biopsies, the mean number of NF-200-positive axons amounted to 38\% (range, 6-81\%) of that in control samples. Further, regenerated axons were thinner than in control samples. Morphologically, the grafted nerves were characterized by fibrosis and invasion of inflammatory cells. A longer time between cross-facial nerve grafting and biopsy sampling correlated with a higher number of viable axons (NF-200) (P = 0.002). In all cases, expression of p75NGF receptor was clearly higher at the distal end of the grafted nerve. Expression of p75NGFR was lower in older than in younger patients (P = 0.003). A high expression of p75NGFR was often seen with better function of the transplanted muscle. Conclusion: Increased expression of p75NGFR in human nerve grafts was noted, especially in younger patients. We suggest that p75NGFR expression might be a contributing factor in a successful axonal regeneration and eventual recovery of muscle function.},

	abstract = {Background: Mini-temporalis transposition (MTT) flaps, modified from Gillies' technique, have become less popular than temporalis tendon transfers for miDFace reanimation. MTT involves raising the middle third of the temporalis, transposition over the zygomatic arch and lengthening with deep temporalis fascia which is sutured to the orbicularis oris. Aim: This retrospective study assessed subjective and objective outcomes following MTTs by a single surgeon from 2009 to 2019. Methods: Operative and surgical details were recorded. Four blinded consultants rated pre- and postoperative videos according to Terzis' scale. Pre- and postoperative resting, Mona Lisa and canine smile photographs were analysed using Emotrics, the software that automatically computes differences in inter-landmark distances. Patients also completed the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) patient-rated outcome measure. Results: Forty-one patients (mean age 65.8 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 15.5) underwent MTT, median 3 (0.4-57) years post-paralysis and were followed up for median of 2.2 (0.4-8.8) years. Higher mean postoperative Terzis score demonstrates symmetric and aesthetic improvements (3 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 1.3 vs. 2 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 1; p{\textless}0.05). Emotrics analysis showed postoperative improvements in resting and dynamic symmetry of all indices, with the majority statistically significant (p{\textless}0.003). The mean GBI was 35.19 with 17 (94.4\%) patients reporting improvement, whereas one (5.6\%) patient reported detriment after surgery. Two (5.4\%) patients suffered complications: one haematoma and one infection. Four patients (9.8\%) required revisional flap tightening. No patients requested revisional surgery for temporal hollowing or zygomatic fullness. Conclusions: MTT effectively improves both subjective and objective resting and dynamic miDFace symmetry in a single stage. These results suggest this technique is a good alternative to temporalis tendon transfer techniques.},

All patients had preoperative indication for physiotherapy and rehabilitation procedures (local massage and mirror therapy). Facial nerve function was evaluated using the Arianna Disease Scale. Results: The cosmetic outcome improved in all cases, with marked amelioration of the preoperative facial asymmetry. Oral competence was enhanced by elevating the oral commissure and reinforcing the cheek, and amelioration of symptoms related to lagophthalmos was achieved through increased support and decreased pull on the inferior eyelid. The addition of physiotherapy with specific rehabilitation exercises before the surgical intervention increased the success rate. Conclusion: This technique proved to be a good alternative to other static reanimation procedures because of its straightforward technique, availability, good outcomes, low complication rate, and ability to perform minor adjustments and corrections at any time.},

	abstract = {Background: The superficial temporal fascia merits its popularity in reconstructive surgery for its large number of clinical applications. In this report, the authors present their experience with different uses of the superficial temporal fascial flap in facial reanimation. Methods: Seventeen cases are presented. In 10 patients, the fascial flap provided a vascularized lining at the interface between the free muscle flap for smile restoration and the overlying skin. In six cases, it was utilized to correct small or moderate contour deficits in the paretic hemiface, using either the fascial flap alone or in combination with free adipose tissue. One patient presented with facial paralysis and Frey syndrome following parotidectomy, and the fascial flap was used to control gustatory sweating. Five independent observers graded aesthetic and functional outcomes on a scale from poor to excellent. Three patients were lost to follow-up, so 14 cases were evaluated. Results: Follow-up ranged from 1 to 216 months (47 +/- 60.49 months). The specific reconstructive goal for each patient was achieved and the overall symmetry was greatly improved, with all patients being granted higher scores by the panel of observers following the superficial fascia flap (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed ranks, p {\textless} 0.0001). Transient or permanent alopecia along the temporal incision was the main complication observed. Conclusions: Transfer of the superficial temporal fascia flap is a valuable technique with several potential applications in facial paralysis management and reconstructive surgery in general. The advantages of this highly vascularized, gliding, and pliable flap far outweigh the associated minimal complications.},

We aimed to analyze long-term outcome and complications of this procedure. Patients and methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients undergoing SCM reanimation for longstanding facial palsy between January 2009 and December 2015. Patients with follow-up longer than 12 months (range=12-96) were included in the study. Facial muscle function was evaluated before and at each follow-up after the surgery with the House-Brackmann (HB) scale-facial nerve grading system and Facegram analysis. Donor site morbidity and overall complication rates were documented and analyzed. Results: Forty-two patients aged 18-66 years (mean age=37) with a mean duration of facial palsy of 5 years (range=2-48) met the inclusion criteria. The HB score 2 years after surgery improved significantly (p{\textless}0.05) in comparison to the pre-operative condition (3.6 vs. 4.7). Twelve months after surgery, oral commissure excursion improved by mean 8.95 mm. No flap necrosis occurred, nor compromise of neck and shoulder function despite an obvious contour defect in the SCM donor site. None of the patients presented head posture or movement issues. Conclusion: The SCM flap transfer is a reliable and effective procedure to achieve moderate improvement of the oral commissure excursion using a local method with moderate donor site morbidity. It can be regarded as a valuable option for dynamic facial reanimation in case of longstanding facial palsy.},

However, no comparative study of these two procedures has yet been reported. In this two-site, two-arm, retrospective case review study, 32 patients were included. Of these, 17 patients (eight men and nine women, mean age 42.1 years) underwent interposition nerve graft after tumor extirpation or trauma between 2003 and 2006 in the Ear Institute, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, and 15 patients (six men and nine women, mean age 40.6 years) underwent masseter-to-facial nerve transfer after tumor extirpation or trauma between November 2010 and February 2016 in Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, China. More patients achieved House-Brackmann III recovery after masseter nerve repair than interposition nerve graft repair (15/15 vs. 12/17). The mean oral commissure excursion ratio was also higher in patients who underwent masseter nerve transfer than in patients subjected to an interposition nerve graft. These findings suggest that masseter nerve transfer results in strong oral commissure excursion, avoiding obvious synkinesis, while an interposition nerve graft provides better resting symmetry.

This study presents the authors' experience using vastus lateralis muscle as a chimeric flap with anterolateral thigh flap to allow both soft-tissue reconstruction and dynamic reanimation in radical parotidectomy. Methods: A retrospective review of the medical records of cancer patients who had undergone radical parotidectomy and reconstruction using a chimeric vastus lateralis and anterolateral thigh flap between March of 2013 and May of 2017 was performed using the Sydney Head and Neck Cancer Institute database.

Results: A total of 27 patients were included in the study with an average age of 72 years (range, 31 to 88 years). Thirteen patients (48 percent) had developed dynamic function by the end of the study period. Young age predicted a more rapid return to dynamic function (p = 0.018).

On multivariable analysis, superior miDFace dynamic function was associated with neurotization using miDFace facial nerve branches as opposed to using nerve-to-masseter alone (p = 0.05). Conclusion: The chimeric vastus lateralis and anterolateral thigh flap is a suitable option for restoring defects and dynamic function following radical parotidectomy.

	title = {The incidence of facial vessel agenesis in patients with syndromic congenital facial palsy},
	abstract = {Background: Congenital facial palsy can result in significant disfigurement. A potential treatment option is free functional muscle transfer to reanimate the face. For this to be possible, a suitable recipient artery and vein must be present in the affected hemiface. In this study, the authors aim to identify whether patients with syndromic congenital facial palsy have a higher rate of facial vessel agenesis than those with isolated congenital facial palsy. Methods: Patients were identified between November of 2006 and October of 2013. Patients were stratified into two groups: those with syndromic congenital facial palsy and those with isolated congenital facial palsy. The presence or absence of facial vessels was determined intraoperatively. Results: Forty-seven eligible patients were included in the study. Those with syndromic congenital facial palsy were significantly more likely to have an absent facial vein than patients with isolated congenital facial palsy (p = 0.015). There was a strong trend toward those with syndromic facial palsy lacking a facial artery (p = 0.08). Subgroup analysis of patients with M‚àö‚àÇbius syndrome revealed that these patients were significantly more likely to have facial artery agenesis than those with isolated congenital facial palsy (p = 0.03). Conclusions: Facial vessel agenesis is significantly more common in patients with syndromic congenital facial palsy compared with those with isolated congenital facial palsy. This must be considered in the preoperative planning for facial reanimation with free functional muscle transfer. The operating surgeon should consider vascular studies of the affected hemiface before undertaking the procedure.},

	title = {Intraoperative muscle electrical stimulation for accurate positioning of the temporalis muscle tendon during dynamic, one-stage lengthening temporalis myoplasty for facial and lip reanimation},
	abstract = {Background: Facial paralysis is a significant functional and aesthetic handicap. Facial reanimation is performed either by two-stage microsurgical methods or by regional one-stage muscle pedicle flaps. Labb‚àö¬© has modified and improved the regional muscle pedicle transfer flaps for facial reanimation (i.e., the lengthening temporalis myoplasty procedure). This true myoplasty technique is capable of producing a coordinated, spontaneous, and symmetrical smile. An intraoperative electrical stimulation of the temporal muscle is proposed to simulate the smile of the paralyzed side on the surgical table. Methods: The intraoperative electrical stimulation of the temporalis muscle, employing direct percutaneous electrode needles or transcutaneous electrical stimulation electrodes, was utilized in 11 primary and four secondary cases with complete facial palsy. The duration of the facial paralysis was up to 12 years. Postoperative follow-up ranged from 3 to 12 months. Results: The insertion points of the temporalis muscle tendon to the nasolabial fold, upper lip, and oral commissure had been changed according to the intraoperative muscle stimulation in six patients of the 11 primary cases (55 percent) and in all four secondary (revisional) cases. A coordinated, spontaneous, and symmetrical smile was achieved in all patients by 3 months after surgery by employing speech therapy and biofeedback. Conclusion: This adjunct intraoperative refinement provides crucial feedback for the surgeon in both primary and secondary facial palsy cases regarding the vector of action of the temporalis muscle and the accuracy of the anchoring points of its tendon, thus enhancing a more coordinated and symmetrical smile.},

	abstract = {Objective: To examine functional outcomes following end-to-trunk masseteric to facial nerve transfer in patients with chronic flaccid facial paralysis. Design: Retrospective chart review. Setting: Tertiary-care private practice setting. Participants: Patients with complete unilateral facial paralysis of less than 24 months duration. Interventions: Direct end-to-trunk masseteric to facial nerve anastomosis. Outcome measures: Outcome measures included time to first movement, development of synkinesis, and an objective assessment of the resting tone and dynamic movement that was achieved. Results: Patient age at the time of transfer ranged from 6 to 61. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 24 months. No patients had any perioperative complications. No patient experienced significant mass movement or synkinetic facial movement with chewing. No patient had worsened chewing or swallowing. Patients have not yet recovered significant resting tone. All patients achieved smile activity when biting down with a median (interquartile range) oral commissure excursion of 7.57 mm (5.19-9.94 mm), starting 3 to 5 months after transfer. Conclusions: End-to-trunk masseteric to facial nerve transfer is a safe and effective procedure. Patients had rapid reinnervation with good excursion and achieved a natural appearing smile. The rehabilitated smile appears better than that achieved with hypoglossal-facial nerve transfer. The procedure can be performed coincident with cross-facial nerve grafting, and in some cases may produce dynamic facial movement that obviates the need for free muscle transfer.},

	abstract = {Background: Six hundred fifty-five cases of unilateral facial paralysis were treated by different surgical methods to achieve dynamic reanimation of facial muscle movement. In a retrospective study, the recovery of both truly spontaneous smile and facial muscle movement was evaluated independently. Methods: The authors performed 505 two-stage gracilis, one rectus abdominis, and 14 single-stage latissimus dorsi microneurovascular muscle transfers, in addition to 28 cross-facial facial nerve neurotization procedures. These procedures were based on neurotization of the paralyzed region by the contralateral healthy facial nerve. Procedures involving motor nerves or muscle beyond the territory of the facial nerve included 73 temporalis muscle transpositions, four lengthening temporalis myoplasty procedures, 26 neurotizations by the hypoglossal nerve, and four neurotizations by the spinal accessory nerve. Results: Patients treated by techniques based on the motor function of nerves other than the facial nerve did not recover spontaneous smile. Neurotization by the facial nerve, however, did result in the recovery of spontaneous smile in all satisfactory or better outcomes. Recovery of lip commissure movement based on neurotization by the contralateral healthy facial nerve was better than that of the remaining groups (p {\textless} 0.0001). Conclusions: Temporalis muscle transposition and lengthening myoplasty are acceptable options for patients who are not good candidates for neurotization by the facial nerve. For the restoration of both truly spontaneous smile and facial muscle movement, free microneurovascular muscle transfer neurotized by the contralateral healthy facial nerve has become the authors' first-choice surgical technique.

Methods: We report a case series of 17 consecutive patients with facial paralysis who underwent minimally invasive temporalis tendon transposition surgery for dynamic facial reanimation between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2008. The minimally invasive technique is described. Preoperative and postoperative records, photographs, and videos were reviewed for feasibility of the technique, symmetry, oral competence, and dynamic oral commissure movement. Results: All the patients tolerated the procedure well, and none developed procedure-related complications. All the patients achieved improved symmetry at rest and voluntary motion of the oral commissure. In all the patients, the temporalis tendon was transposed to the modiolus without the need for fascial extension or lengthening myoplasty. Conclusions: The temporalis tendon can be transposed for immediate dynamic reanimation of the paralyzed lower face using a minimally invasive approach. This procedure involves a single small incision and minimal dissection, with no major osteotomies. Acquisition of desired facial movement requires intensive physiotherapy and a motivated patient.},

This paper presents patient-rated outcomes (PROMS) in an 11-year series of both single and two-stage anterior belly of digastric muscle (ABDM) lower lip reanimations. Demographics, paralysis characteristics, operative details, and complications were recorded. Patients were telephoned and requested to complete the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) to assess patient-rated outcomes. Thirty-two patients were eligible (mean age 36.4 years). Twenty-one (63.6\%) completed the GBI (mean score +33.3). More patients reported benefit than detriment (95.2\% vs 4.8\%). Complications were infrequent and included three cases of superficial infections and one of dermatitis. Four patients (12.5\%) underwent minor revisions, mostly lipofilling of lip notches. The median (range) duration of follow up was 2.8 (0.3 - 8.5) years.

Study design: A fixed-effects reliability study in which 6 otolaryngologists viewed videotapes of patients with facial nerve paralysis. Setting: University and medical Centers. Patients: Patients with unilateral lower motor neurone facial nerve dysfunction greater than 1 year after onset, none of whom had undergone surgical reanimation procedures. Intervention Twenty-one patients with facial nerve paralysis were videotaped while they performed a protocol of facial movements. Six otolaryngologists viewed the videotapes and scored them with the Sydney and Sunnybrook systems, and then gave a House Brackmann grade. Main outcome measure: The 3 systems of grading facial nerve paralysis were evaluated and compared with the use of intraclass correlation coefficients, Pearson's weighted kappa, and percentage exact agreement values. Results: The Sydney and the Sunnybrook systems had good intrasystem reliability and high intersystem association for the assessment of voluntary movement. Grading of synkinesis was found to have low reliability both within and between systems. The House Brackmann system had substantial reliability as shown by weighted kappa but had a percentage exact agreement of 44\%. Conclusions: For clinical grading of voluntary movement, there is good correlation between ratings given on the Sydney and Sunnybrook systems, and within each system there is good reliability. The assessment of synkinesis was far less reliable within, and less related between, systems. Although the reliability of the House Brackmann system was found to be high, examination of individual grades revealed some wide variation between trained observers.},

	abstract = {Background: Single-stage latissimus dorsi neuromuscular transfer has been a valuable option for dynamic smile reanimation. However, there is a paucity of studies evaluating the potential donor morbidity in such cases. The present study aimed to comprehensively analyze the donor morbidity following functional latissimus dorsi muscle transfer. Methods: Patients who underwent single-stage functional latissimus dorsi muscle transfer for smile reanimation between 2002 and 2016 were reviewed. Postoperative complications and functional impairments at the donor sites were evaluated. The Quick-Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire was used for assessing postoperative donor-site function. Results: Sixty patients, including 12 pediatric (18 years or younger) patients, were analyzed. Mean length of a harvested thoracodorsal nerve was 14.9 cm. Fourteen patients were treated with a dual innervation technique, in which both a descending and a transverse branch of the thoracodorsal nerve were harvested. Donor complications were observed in seven cases; all of them were seromas and resolved by simple aspiration. No other complications including scoliosis and sensory and/or motor disturbances in the upper extremities were encountered. Fifty patients responded to the Quick-Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire at a median follow-up of 51 months. The average score was 2.64, and all but three patients scored less than 10. No variables, including patient age (pediatric versus adult) and the use of a dual-innervation technique, affected the donor morbidities, including the functional deficits. Conclusion: Single-stage latissimus dorsi neuromuscular transfer for facial reanimation might be associated with a low rate of complications and minimal functional morbidity at the donor site.

Masseteric nerve has numerous advantages like its proximity to the facial nerve, stronger motor impulse, its reliability, low morbidity in harvesting and sacrificing the nerve and faster re-innervation that is achievable in most patients. The present case series demonstrate the surgical technique and the effectiveness of the masseteric nerve as donor for early facial reanimation. Between January 2017 and February 2019, 6 patients (2 male, 4 female) with iatrogenic unilateral complete facial paralysis (grade VI, House Brackmann scale) who underwent masseteric-facial nerve anastomosis were included in the study. The time interval between the onset of paralysis and surgery ranged from 4 to 18 months (mean 8.5 months). In all patients pre-operative electromyography had facial mimetic muscle fibrillation potentials. All patients underwent end to end anastomosis except for one patient where greater auricular interposition graft was used. In all cases, the facial muscles showed earliest sign of recovery at 2-5 months. These movements were first noticed on the cheek musculature when the patients activated their masseter muscle. Eye movements started appearing at 6-9 months (in 3 cases) and forehead movements at 18 months (in 1 case). According to the modified House-Brackmann grading scale, one patient had Grade I function, two patients had Grade II function, and three had Grade V function. There was no morbidity except one patient who underwent interposition graft had numbness in the ear lobule. None of the patients could feel the loss of masseteric nerve function. Masseteric facial nerve anastomosis is a versatile, powerful early facial dynamic reanimation tool with almost negligible morbidity compared to other neurotization procedures for patients with complete facial nerve paralysis.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes of this technique in adult patients. Methods: Eighty-one adult patients received a free-muscle transfer for miDFace reanimation in the authors' center. Of this group, the authors identified 24 cases with follow-up of 5 years or longer. Smile symmetry and function were evaluated at three points: preoperatively, early postoperatively, and at long-term follow-up. To better evaluate the effect of time, patients were divided into groups according to the length of follow-up: group A, 5 to 6 years; group B, 7 to 10 years; group C, 11 to 15 years; and group D, more than 15 years. Four independent observers rated each patient's smile using a five-category scale ranging from poor to excellent. Panelists were asked to comment on whether the patient's smile weakened over time. Results: All patients obtained higher scores at 2 years from free-muscle transfer in comparison with their preoperative rates (p {\textless} 0.0001). Late outcomes demonstrated that muscle regeneration continues beyond the initial 2 years, with a further increase of the scores and motor units on electromyography at the late follow-up (p {\textless} 0.0001, p = 0.0313). No significance was found when comparing both variables among the four groups, indicating that time does not have a differential effect on muscle function. In 80 percent of the evaluations, the four observers agreed on maintained smile symmetry over time. Conclusions: Cross-facial nerve grafting/free-muscle transfer is an effective technique for smile restoration in late facial paralysis. These data indicate maintenance of effective muscle function and progressive improvement with time.},

Few reports describe the prevalence and factors related to the development of synkinesis after facial paralysis. Botulinum toxin type A injection is an important adjunct treatment for facial paralysis-induced asymmetry and synkinesis. The authors assessed the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of patients with sequelae of facial paralysis treated with botulinum toxin type A injections to evaluate the prevalence of synkinesis and related factors. Methods: A total of 353 patients (age, 4 to 84 years; 245 female patients) with longstanding facial paralysis underwent 2312 botulinum toxin type A injections during an 11-year follow-up. Doses used over the years, previous treatments (electrical stimulation, operations), and how they correlated to postparalysis and postreanimation synkinesis were analyzed. Results: There was a significant association between cause and surgery. Most patients with facial paralysis caused by a congenital defect, trauma, or a tumor underwent reanimation. There were no sex- or synkinesis-related differences in the doses used, but the doses were higher in the reanimation group than in the no-surgery group. Synkinesis was found in 196 patients; 148 (41.9 percent) presented with postparalysis synkinesis (oro-ocular, oculo-oral) and 58 (16.4 percent) presented with postreanimation synkinesis. Ten patients presented with both types. Conclusions: This study determined the high prevalence (55.5 percent) of synkinesis in patients with longstanding facial paralysis. Postparalysis synkinesis was positively associated with infectious and idiopathic causes, electrical stimulation, facial nerve decompression, and no requirement for surgery. Postreanimation synkinesis was present in 28.2 percent of reanimated patients and was significantly associated with microsurgical flaps, transfacial nerve grafting, masseteric-facial anastomosis, and temporalis muscle transfers.},

	abstract = {Background: M‚àö‚àÇbius syndrome is a disorder characterized by developmental impairment of cranial nerve VII, VI, often XII, and other cranial nerves. Facial reanimation in such patients restores the ability of some motion and of limited emotional expression. In one-fourth of these patients, hypoglossal involvement results in severe speech impairment due to tongue atrophy and lack of voluntary mobility. Bilabial incompetence due to facial paralysis further deteriorates speech capability. Direct tongue neurotization has been used by the senior author (J.K.T) to improve tongue function and speech intelligibility in patients with M‚àö‚àÇbius syndrome. This study presents the senior author's experience with the technique as a component of multistage facial reanimation procedures. Methods: Data collection was performed by retrospective review on six patients with M‚àö‚àÇbius syndrome who underwent direct tongue neurotization. In addition, each patient was videotaped for 30 minutes preoperatively and postoperatively according to a standardized protocol. Results: Four independent investigators scored speech intelligibility in each patient using a standardized grading system. The results showed considerable improvement in speech intelligibility and articulation. Higher improvement was noted in patients with partial bilateral hypoglossal involvement than in patients with complete unilateral involvement of the hypoglossal nerve, as well as in younger ages. No difference was noted between sexes. Conclusions: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study presenting the effect of direct tongue neurotization on speech intelligibility in patients with M‚àö‚àÇbius syndrome. Tongue neurotization has therefore an important role in restoring the ability of these patients to communicate and obtain the potential to develop normal social skills.},

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare preoperative versus postoperative measurements of upper eyelid excursion and blinking velocity determined with FACIAL CLIMA. Significance was set at p {\textless}0.05. Results: FACIAL CLIMA revealed significant improvement of eyelid excursion and velocity of blinking (p {\textless} 0.001). Eye dryness improved in 49 patients (90.7\%) and corneal ulcer resolved without any further treatment in 12 (85.7\%) of those with a gold weight inserted. Implant extrusion was observed in 8.6\% of the cases. Of the patients with lower lid tendon suspension, correction of ptosis/ectropion and epiphora was achieved in 93.9\% and 91.9\% of cases, respectively. In eight patients (18.6\%), further surgery was needed to adjust tendon tension. Conclusions: The paralytic upper and lower eyelid can be successfully managed with gold weight implant and tendon suspension. The FACIAL CLIMA system is a reliable method to quantify upper eyelid excursion and blinking velocity and to detect the exact position of the lower eyelid.},

	abstract = {Paralysis of the facial mimetic muscles causes loss of voluntary and non-voluntary muscle function, as well as facial tone. This is a devastating condition with profound functional, aesthetic and psychological consequences. Etiologies include congenital paralysis and acquired paralysis following viral infection, trauma, head and neck tumors, iatrogenic damage and more. Clinical presentation includes ocular symptoms (dry eye, epiphora, corneal irritation), nasal symptoms (nasal obstruction) and oral symptoms (drooling and speech disturbances). Reconstruction of facial nerve function is based on renewing the neural input to the paralyzed face in parallel with transferring a functioning muscle. The gold standard in long term facial paralysis reanimation includes a two-stage procedure that involves cross-face nerve grafting and later on a free gracilis muscle transfer. This method allows reconstruction of a symmetric, spontaneous and voluntary smile. In cases when cross-face nerve grafting is impossible, a free-gracilis muscle transfer is performed with neural coaptation to another cranial nerve, most commonly the motor nerve to the masseter muscle (of the trigeminal nerve). Non-microsurgical methods for facial reanimation exist, however, nowadays they are rarely performed. In addition to the surgical reconstruction, other surgical and non-surgical procedures are performed for functional and aesthetic symmetrization purposes. These include fat injection to the face, botulinum toxin injection, oculoplastic procedures and more. In this article we describe our patient population with facial nerve paralysis, common facial reanimation procedures, considerations in choosing the appropriate reconstruction procedure and the general approach for treatment of facial paralysis in our multidisciplinary facial paralysis clinic.},

	abstract = {Four patients who underwent functioning free muscle transplantation (FFMT) for facial reconstruction developed a progressive disfiguring muscle contracture. This complication has not been previously reported. Three of the patients had longstanding facial paralysis and were reanimated by FFMT. The fourth patient had left hemifacial atrophy but without facial paralysis. She also underwent FFMT for augmentation. All four FFMTs were innervated by the ipsilateral facial nerve. Initially, they all had a normal facial appearance at rest during the first few months after FFMT. However, they all developed a progressive severe muscle contracture from 6 to 12 months after FFMT. Continuous spontaneous electrical impulse activity, which stimulated the transferred muscle day and night, may be responsible for the progressive muscle contracture. From the patients' reported sensations and from clinical evaluation, which included a local xylocaine injection test, over-reinnervation with a synkinesis effect of the transferred muscle is hypothetically the main cause, not over-tension of the muscle itself. This complication may possibly be avoided by limiting or decreasing the number of fascicles from the ipsilateral facial nerve or better by using a cross-facial nerve graft instead of the ipsilateral facial nerve as the innervating motor nerve. The outcome with a cross-facial nerve is likely to be more predictable and reliable.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The nerve-to-masseter is one of the most frequently used neural sources in smile reanimation surgery. Very little information has been reported on patient experience with regard to reanimated smile usage and sequelae following transfer. The aim of this study was to quantify patient perception of nerve-to-masseter use in smile reanimation surgery. Methods: An online questionnaire was developed based on the clinical expertise of our team, patient interviews, and existing questionnaires of facial palsy-related quality of life and temporomandibular joint dysfunction. All patients treated with nerve-to-masseter-driven smile reanimation surgery, both nerve transfers and muscle transplantations, between 2007 and 2016 with a valid email address were invited to participate. Results: Of 171 operated patients, 122 with a valid email address were invited to participate. Seventy-one patients responded (63.4\% female, mean age 51.1 years) after a median follow-up of 3.8 years. A voluntary smile while biting down at least "most of the time" was reported by 83.1\% of patients; 46.5\% reported ability to smile on the affected side without bite. A "normal" or "almost normal" spontaneous smile was reported in 23.9\% of patients. A total of 18.3\% of patients self-reported masseter muscle atrophy, and 1.4-14.1\% reported temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Forty-one patients (57.7\%) reported prandial movement of the face at least "most of the time," with 9 patients (12.7\%) considering this bothersome. Conclusion: Patients report good voluntary smiling ability following nerve-to-masseter-driven smile reanimation surgery, with low rates of sequelae.},

Objective: To identify factors associated with health-related quality of life in patients with facial palsy. Design, setting, and participants: The inclusion period for participants in this cross-sectional study at the University Medical Center Groningen, a tertiary referral center for facial reanimation surgery, was March 1 to June 1, 2019. Patients aged at least 18 years with facial palsy who had undergone surgery for facial palsy between January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2018, and patients visiting the outpatient clinic of the University of Groningen Department of Plastic Surgery for their facial palsy between March 1 and June 1, 2019, were also asked to participate. Of 276 patients invited, 145 gave informed consent. Twenty patients did not respond after consent, 3 patients withdrew from the study, and 1 patient was wrongly included. Main outcomes and measures: Health-related quality of life was measured using the Facial Clinimetric Evaluation Scale and the Facial Disability Index (physical score and social score). Facial function was assessed with the Sunnybrook Facial Grading System. Other variables were investigated using validated questionnaires, including the Duke University Religion Index, Ten-Item Personality Inventory, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Multivariable linear regression analyses with stepwise backward selection were performed to identify associations with health-related quality of life. Because 44 Sunnybrook composite scores were missing, a sensitivity analysis was performed that excluded the Sunnybrook composite scores from the multivariable analysis. Results: In total, 121 patients with facial palsy were included; their median age was 62 years (interquartile range, 48-71 years), and 63 (52\%) were women. Sunnybrook composite score (‚âà√≠‚Äö√¢¬ß = 0.4; 95\% CI, 0.2-0.5), extraversion (‚âà√≠‚Äö√¢¬ß = 2.6; 95\% CI, 0.4-4.8), and anxiety (‚âà√≠‚Äö√¢¬ß = -2.4; 95\% CI, -4.1 to -0.8) were associated with the Facial Clinimetric Evaluation Scale total score (R2 = 0.380; 95\% CI, 0.212-0.548). The Sunnybrook composite score was associated with the Facial Disability Index physical score (‚âà√≠‚Äö√¢¬ß = 0.2; 95\% CI, 0.0-0.4) (R2 = 0.084; 95\% CI, -0.037 to 0.205). Bilateral facial palsy (‚âà√≠‚Äö√¢¬ß = -21.2; 95\% CI, -32.3 to -10.1), extraversion (‚âà√≠‚Äö√¢¬ß = 2.7; 95\% CI, 1.3-4.1), conscientiousness (‚âà√≠‚Äö√¢¬ß = 2.7; 95\% CI, 0.2-5.2), emotional stability (‚âà√≠‚Äö√¢¬ß = 3.3; 95\% CI, 1.7-4.8), and depression (‚âà√≠‚Äö√¢¬ß = -1.3; 95\% CI, -2.5 to -0.1) were associated with the Facial Disability Index social score (R2 = 0.400; 95\% CI, 0.262-0.538). In the sensitivity analysis, the Sunnybrook composite score was associated with age (Spearman ‚âà√¨‚àö√ñ = -0.252). Conclusions and relevance: Bilateral facial palsy, age, severity of facial palsy, mental distress, and personality traits should be taken into account in future research and treatment of patients with facial palsy.},

	title = {Selective marginal mandibular neurectomy for treatment of the marginal mandibular lip deformity in patients with chronic unilateral facial palsies},
	abstract = {Background: For unilateral facial palsies, reanimation techniques such as cross-facial nerve grafting with free muscle transfer have been very successful at improving symmetrical lip elevation when smiling. However, these procedures do not address the residual asymmetry with respect to lip depression resulting from an uncorrected marginal mandibular nerve palsy. Techniques that do address this residual lip asymmetry have had variable results. Selective neurectomy of the unaffected marginal mandibular nerve has largely been abandoned as a treatment since it has been reported to result in severe oral functional and cosmetic deficiencies. The authors argue that selective marginal mandibular neurectomy is a reliable technique for treatment of the marginal mandibular lip deformity that does not compromise oral functionality. Methods: Thirteen patients with unilateral facial palsies underwent selective marginal mandibular neurectomy of the unaffected side; the procedure was performed by the principal investigator. These patients were then evaluated on the basis of symmetry with smiling and oral functionality. Twelve of the patients were contacted and questioned with a standardized questionnaire. Twelve of the patients were evaluated independently for symmetry with smiling using randomized preoperative and postoperative photographs. Results: Eleven of the 12 patients reported either improvement or no change in oral competence. Ten of the 12 patients reported either improvement or great improvement in symmetry with smiling. Improvement in symmetry with smiling was independently observed 77.2 percent of the time. Conclusion: These results support selective marginal mandibular neurectomy of the unaffected side in patients with unilateral facial palsies as a means of improving symmetry with smiling without compromising functionality.},

	abstract = {Background: Masseteric and hypoglossal nerve transfers are reliable alternatives for reanimating short-term facial paralysis. To date, few studies exist in the literature comparing these techniques. This work presents a quantitative comparison of masseter-facial transposition versus hemihypoglossal facial transposition with a nerve graft using the Facial Clima system. Methods: Forty-six patients with complete unilateral facial paralysis underwent reanimation with either hemihypoglossal transposition with a nerve graft (group I, n = 25) or direct masseteric-facial coaptation (group II, n = 21). Commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity were measured using the Facial Clima system. Postoperative intragroup commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity means of the reanimated versus the normal side were first compared using a paired sample t test. Then, mean percentages of recovery of both parameters were compared between the groups using an independent sample t test. Onset of movement was also compared between the groups. Results: Significant differences of mean commissural displacement and commissural contraction velocity between the reanimated side and the normal side were observed in group I but not in group II. Mean percentage of recovery of both parameters did not differ between the groups. Patients in group II showed a significantly faster onset of movement compared with those in group I (62 ¬¨¬± 4.6 days versus 136 ¬¨¬± 7.4 days, p = 0.013). Conclusions: Reanimation of short-term facial paralysis can be satisfactorily addressed by means of either hemihypoglossal transposition with a nerve graft or direct masseteric-facial coaptation. However, with the latter, better symmetry and a faster onset of movement are observed. In addition, masseteric nerve transfer avoids morbidity from nerve graft harvesting.

	abstract = {Objectives: On the basis of survey results of the Acoustic Neuroma Association, we report patient ratings of facial dysfunction and outcomes for various facial rehabilitative therapies after surgical treatment of acoustic neuroma (AN). We assessed patients' perceived quality of life (QOL) and reviewed the literature regarding facial dysfunction and its management associated with AN. Study design: The Acoustic Neuroma Association mailed a detailed questionnaire to 2,372 members to identify preoperative and postoperative symptoms, complications, and long-term effects on physical and psychosocial function. A cohort of 1,595 (82.2\%) respondents who underwent surgical treatment of ANs reported their experiences with facial dysfunction. Patients: Of all 1,940 survey respondents, 1,682 of 1,875 that had ANs underwent surgical treatment. The study included 1,595 patients with ANs (82.2\% of all respondents) who underwent surgical treatment by way of the translabyrinthine, suboccipital, or middle fossa approaches and excluded 87 respondents who did not report the type of surgical approach. Methods: Respondents answered questions intended to qualify and quantify the degree that facial dysfunction impacted QOL parameters. Responses were analyzed for tumor size, surgical approach, patient age, and sex. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. Results: In our analysis, 11\% of all respondents experienced some degree of preoperative facial weakness or eye problems. Of all respondents, 45.5\% (725 patients) experienced worsened facial weakness caused by surgery, and of these, 72\% reported that it was permanent. The most commonly used successful therapy for facial reanimation for 271 (19.6\%) patients was placement of a gold weight. The factor most often associated with poor outcome was a large tumor. Of all respondents, 28\% felt significantly affected by facial weakness, 63\% felt their smile was symmetric, and 70\% were content "quite a bit" or "very much" with their QOL. Conclusions: In this large cohort study of AN patients, facial dysfunction was a significant morbidity. Physicians should be aware of the risk factors identified, specifically large tumor size and the impact facial dysfunction has on QOL, when counseling patients regarding optimal management of AN.},

	abstract = {Facial nerve palsy is an exceedingly debilitating condition, incapacitating functional and aesthetic facets of the face. Orthodromic transfer of temporalis muscle is an easy and predictable technique which offers early animation of oral commissure and lower face. A retrospective chart review of 6 patients of facial palsy treated with orthodromic temporalis tendon transfer for facial reanimation is presented. The technique consisted of intra-oral coronoidectomy followed by attachment of fascia lata grafts from the coronoid to the commissure, the upper and lower lips via small cutaneous incisions. Contraction of the temporalis, pulls the fascia lata extensions thereby reanimating the lower face. 4 male and 2 female patients with an age range of 25 to 49 years were treated. Simultaneous fat grafting (2 patients), depressor labi inferioris muscle resection (2 patients) and wedge excision of nasolabial fold (2 patients) was done as ancillary procedures. Post-operative smile evaluation was carried out using the Terzis and Noah facial grading system. Patients were asked to smile with and without biting, and photographs and video were taken. The results were graded from 1 to 5 based on a 5-point scale (ie, poor, fair, moderate, good, and excellent) by an independent observer. The results were excellent in 1 patient (Terzis grading 5/5) and good in the remaining 5 patients (Terzis grading 4/5). Excursion of the oral commissure ranged from 6 to 10 mm. Our experience indicates that temporalis tendon transfer for facial reanimation has a short learning curve and provides early predictable outcome without significant complications. This single-stage, day-care procedure can be easily incorporated by maxillofacial surgeons to expand their surgical spectrum.},

Methods: : Patients presenting with microtia were assessed according to the OMENS [orbital deformity, mandibular hypoplasia, ear deformity, nerve (cranialnerve VII) involvement, and soft-tissue deficiency] criteria, and also imaged to establish the presence or absence of the anterior belly of the digastric muscle. Each affected hemiface was treated as an individual case (n = 50), with unaffected hemifaces being assigned as controls (an additional group of unaffected controls were also included). The hemifaces with microtia were then subdivided into three groups: those with isolated microtia (with anterior belly of the digastric muscle present), those with features consistent with hemifacial microsomia (with the anterior belly of the digastric muscle present), and those with absent anterior belly of the digastric muscle. Results: : Anterior belly of the digastric muscle agenesis rate was 40 percent in those patients displaying features consistent with hemifacial microsomia. Median OMENS scores were significantly different in intergroup analysis (p {\textless} 0.0001), with a trend noticed between the median value for the hemifacial microsomia group and those with absent anterior belly of the digastric muscle. There were no noted incidences of anterior belly of the digastric muscle agenesis in the control group. Conclusions: : The incidence of anterior belly of the digastric muscle agenesis in patients with hemifacial microsomia is high. Before any attempt to undertake lower lip reanimation using this muscle, the floor of the mouth should be imaged to check for its presence.},

The technique was employed during the same surgical session as the tumor removal or for secondary facial reanimation. Systematic eFACE evaluation demonstrated significant improvement in static nasolabial fold depth orientation and oral commissure position, palpebral fissure narrowing during eye closure, and oral commissure movement and nasolabial fold depth and orientation with smile (p respectively .008, .011, 0.008, 0.035, 0.011, 0.008, and 0.011, Wilcoxon's test).

	abstract = {Introduction: In cases of unilateral facial paralysis, free muscle transfer with coaptation to the motor nerve of the Masseter is gaining popularity as a primary alternative to cross-facial nerve grafting. Despite initial expectations, a majority of these subjects can achieve a spontaneous smile. The mechanism behind this spontaneity is unclear. Plasticity of the cerebral cortex as well as the relative proximity of the motor centres of the mimetic and Masseter muscles has been used in explanation. This study demonstrates the involvement of the Masseter muscle during normal smile production, suggesting a more direct explanation for the spontaneous smile seen following reanimation procedures innervated by the Masseter nerve. Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers were subjected to electromyography of the Masseter muscle bilaterally to demonstrate whether contraction of the Masseter muscle occurred during voluntary and involuntary smile production. Results: Patient age ranged from 20 to 61 years (mean 41.6 years) with an equal male to female ratio. Activation of the Masseter occurred in 40 percent of individual muscles during smile production, occurring bilaterally in six participants, and unilaterally in four. There was no correlation between muscle activation and patient age or gender. Conclusions: Natural contraction of the Masseter muscle during normal smile production helps to explain the high rate of spontaneous smile development in subjects with facial paralysis who have undergone a free muscle reanimation procedure powered by the nerve to the Masseter muscle.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Facial paralysis is a congenital or acquired disorder of varying severity leading to an asymmetric or absent facial expression. It represents an important debilitation from both esthetic and functional points of view. In this article we report our experience with patients treated with gracilis muscle transplantation innervated by the motor nerve to the masseter muscle. We discuss the surgical technique and the functional and esthetic results and evaluate the effectiveness of this donor nerve in providing adequate innervation to the muscle transfer for lower facial reanimation. Materials and methods: Fifteen patients with unilateral facial paralysis were seen and surgically treated at the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy, between 2003 and 2007. In this study we report on 8 cases treated with gracilis muscle transfer reinnervated by the motor nerve to the masseter muscle. Results: In this series all free-muscle transplantations survived transfer, and no flap was lost. Facial symmetry at rest and while smiling was excellent or good in all patients, and we observed a significant improvement in speech and oral competence. With practice, the majority of patients developed the ability to smile spontaneously and without jaw movement. Conclusions: We consider the masseter motor nerve a powerful and reliable donor nerve, allowing us to obtain a commissure and upper lip movement similar to those of the normal site for amount and direction. This is why we think that there may be a larger role for the masseter motor nerve for innervation of patients with unilateral facial paralysis who would otherwise have been considered candidates for cross-facial nerve graft innervation of the muscle transfer.},

	abstract = {Objective: To report an approach to facial paralysis in patients for whom dynamic adjacent muscle transfer is determined to be the best treatment option. Methods: Retrospective review of 7 consecutive patients who underwent orthodromic transfer of the temporalis muscle insertion for the treatment of long-standing facial paralysis. Patients underwent facial-retraining physical therapy before and shortly after the procedure. Outcomes measured included patient satisfaction, objective measurements of oral commissure elevation with smiling, and physician grading of preoperative and postoperative patient photographs. Medical records were reviewed for complications. Results: Patient satisfaction was high, with a mean score of 8.5 (possible score of 10). Four patients were physician graded as excellent to superb. The other 3 patients were rated as having good postoperative results. Movement was identified in every patient and ranged from 1.6 to 8.5 mm, with mean movement of the oral commissure of 4.2 mm. One patient developed postoperative salivary fluid collection that required drainage. Conclusions: Temporalis tendon transfer is a relatively easy procedure to perform that has distinct advantages compared with other forms of facial reanimation and provides very good results. This procedure results in improved form and function, may often be performed in a minimally invasive manner, and eliminates the facial asymmetry typically produced by temporalis transfer.},

	abstract = {Facial paralysis in the miDFace causes loss of cheek tonus, asymmetry at rest, and inability to smile. Static suspension is generally performed in patients who cannot tolerate time-consuming dynamic reanimation. Current methods for static slings are overly simplistic. A sling, which is generally fascia lata or palmaris tendon, is placed between the modiolus and the zygomatic arch or the temporalis fascia, with further extension to the midline of the upper end lower lips in 1 vector. Recently, sutures are placed in a multivectorial approach, but suture failure via breakage is the main problem. In this study, the long, thin, and powerful plantaris tendon was used and divided into 3 slips. Placement of these slips and their tension adjustment were revised to provide strong and long-lasting upper lip and the modiolus pull, along with creation of a well-defined nasolabial fold, and to create sufficient cheek tonus. The first slip was positioned at 35 to 45 degrees to the horizontal plane between the modiolus and the upper preauricular area, second slip at 55 to 60 degrees between the upper lip and the deep temporal fascia, and the third slip at 0 to 10 degrees between the lower lip and lower preauricular area with gradually decreasing tension from above to below in 9 patients. Upper 2 slings were also sutured to the dermis of the nasolabial fold to define it optimally. Results were assessed both objectively and subjectively. Symmetry at rest, sufficient cheek tightness to prevent drooling, and a well-defined fold were obtained.},

Postoperatively, rapid nerve sprouting through the vascularized nerve graft and excellent facial reanimation were obtained within 6 months after surgery. This method in one-stage using a vascularized nerve graft is technically easy, requires a short operating time, has minimal donor-site morbidity, and leads to successful nerve regeneration postoperatively.},

	abstract = {We have created a new way of reanimating the face, involving transposition of the masseter muscle combined with tensor fascia lata, and using the zygomatic arch as a trochlea to reconstruct the inferior facial paralysis. We used it on five patients who had facial palsy after excision of malignant parotid tumours. The wide skin defect that exposed the masseter muscle after total parotidectomy was reconstructed with a free flap. This method differs from those of other methods of transposing the masseter muscle in that force is applied at an upper lateral angle. Our method provided dynamic raising of the upper lip, the corner of the mouth, and the nasolabial fold in four patients. We consider it to be useful, particularly for prompt surgical reconstruction of facial palsy after total parotidectomy with a wide defect in the skin of the cheek.},

	abstract = {Background: Facial paralysis is a debilitating condition. Dynamic and static facial reanimation remains a challenge for plastic surgeons and requires important resources. Our objective was to quantify the health state utility assessment (ie, utility score outcomes) of living with unilateral facial paralysis. Methods: Utility assessments using visual analog scale, time trade-off, and standard gamble were used to obtain utility outcome scores for unilateral facial paralysis from a prospective sample of the general population and medical students. Results: A total number of 123 individuals prospectively participated in the study. All measures (visual analog scale, time trade-off, and standard gamble) for unilateral facial paralysis [0.56¬¨¬±0.18, 0.78¬¨¬±0.21, and 0.79¬¨¬±0.21 respectively] were significantly different (P{\textless}0.0001) from the corresponding outcome scores for monocular blindness [0.61¬¨¬±0.21, 0.83¬¨¬±0.21, and 0.85¬¨¬±0.18, respectively] and binocular blindness [0.33¬¨¬±0.18, 0.65¬¨¬±0.28, and 0.65¬¨¬±0.29, respectively]. Linear regression analysis using age, race, income, and education as predictors of each of the utility scores for facial paralysis showed no statistical significance. Conclusions: In samples of the general population and medical students, all utility score outcome measures for facial paralysis were lower than those for monocular blindness. Our sample population, if faced with unilateral facial paralysis, would theoretically undergo facial reanimation procedures with a willingness to sacrifice 8 years of life and be willing to undergo a procedure with a 21\% chance of mortality to attain perfect health, respectively.},

It is an automatic optical motion system that involves placing special reflecting dots on the subject's face and video recording with three infrared-light cameras the subject performing several face movements such as smile, mouth puckering, eye closure and forehead elevation. Images from the cameras are automatically processed with a software program that generates customised information such as 3D data on velocities and areas. The study has been performed in 20 healthy volunteers. The accuracy of the measurement process and the intrarater and interrater reliabilities have been evaluated. Comparison of a known distance and angle with those obtained by FACIAL CLIMA shows that this system is accurate to within 0.13 mm and 0.41 degrees . In conclusion, the accuracy of the FACIAL CLIMA system for evaluation of facial movements is demonstrated and also the high intrarater and interrater reliability. It has advantages with respect to other systems that have been developed for evaluation of facial movements, such as short calibration time, short measuring time, easiness to use and it provides not only distances but also velocities and areas. Thus the FACIAL CLIMA system could be considered as an adequate tool to assess the outcome of facial paralysis reanimation surgery. Thus, patients with facial paralysis could be compared between surgical centres such that effectiveness of facial reanimation operations could be evaluated.},

The temporalis muscle has been the most popular. In the past, one common problem was that the flap was not long enough to reach parts of the face distant from the affected area. To overcome this disadvantage, we have devised a flap consisting of the pedicled temporalis muscle, temporal fascia and galea together and have achieved good static results in paralyzed faces. From June, 1996 to May, 2003, we used this procedure with 38 longstanding facial paralysis patients (16 male and 22 female); 23 had right-sided and 15 had left-sided facial paralysis. The patients were followed-up over three years. Our results were recorded as "Excellent", "Good", "Fair" or "Poor". Excellent or good results were obtained in 33 patients (87\%). In these patients, the static results are very good. The oral commissure on the affected side maintained a favorable position and almost complete symmetry of expression was attained. We have achieved dynamic reconstruction by using a temporalis muscle-galea pedicled flap in 38 longstanding facial paralysis patients. Our results show that this is a good option in treating such patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Permanent loss of the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve (MMBFN) may result from an inadvertent injury or an intentional sacrifice during tumor resection. This may occur in isolation or as a part of total facial nerve palsy. The loss of the MMBFN results in paralysis of the depressors of the ipsilateral lower lip with troublesome cosmetic and functional deficits. Method: A series of 14 patients with permanent loss of the MMBFN during resection of head and neck tumors were treated with the anterior belly of digastric muscle transfer (ABDMT). The loss of the MMBFN occurred in isolation in five patients and formed a part of total facial nerve palsy in nine. Immediate reconstruction was performed on nine patients, and it was done as a secondary procedure in the remainder. Two patients in the latter group had prior facial reanimation, although the paralyzed lower lip was not reconstructed. Results: The average follow-up period was 23.2 (range, 3-48) months. Satisfactory results were achieved in all of the patients, although revision of the ABDMT was required in one patient. Conclusions: ABDMT is a simple and reliable reconstructive technique for restoring the depressor function of the lower lip resulting from MMBFN palsy. It is the treatment of choice during primary extirpative surgery for head and neck tumors when the MMBFN requires sacrifice for tumor clearance or is inadvertently injured. The reconstructive options for MMBFN palsy, particularly in the absence of the anterior belly of digastric muscle, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background: In the past 130 years, the temporalis muscle flap has been used for a variety of different indications. In this age of microsurgery and perforator flaps, the temporalis muscle flap still has many useful applications for craniofacial reconstruction. Methods: Three hundred sixty-six temporalis muscle flaps were performed in a single center between 1978 and 2012. The authors divided the cases into two series-before and after 1994-because, after 1994, they started to perform free flap reconstructions, and indications for reconstruction with a temporalis muscle flap were changed RESULTS:: In the series after 1994, flaps were most commonly used for reconstruction of defects in the maxilla, mandible, and oropharynx, in addition to facial reanimation and filling of orbital defects. Complications included total flap necrosis (1.6 percent) and partial flap necrosis (10.7 percent). The rate of material extrusion at the donor site decreased after porous polyethylene was uniformly used for reconstruction from 17.1 to 7.9 percent. Conclusions: The pedicled temporalis muscle flap continues to have many applications in craniofacial reconstruction. With increasing use of free flaps, the authors' indications for the pedicled temporalis muscle flap are now restricted to (1) orbital filling for congenital or acquired anophthalmia; (2) filling of unilateral maxillectomy defects; and (3) facial reanimation in selected cases of facial nerve palsy.

Lyme disease, Guillain-Barr‚Äö√†√∂¬¨¬© syndrome, and leukemia are several examples. In this article, the authors describe the cause, the initial diagnostic approach, and the management of long-term sequelae of bilateral paralysis that has evolved in the authors' center over the past 13 years. Methods: A chart review was performed to identify all patients diagnosed with bilateral paralysis at the authors' center between January of 2002 and January of 2015. Demographics, signs and symptoms, diagnosis, initial medical treatment, interventions for facial reanimation, and outcomes were reviewed. Results: Of the 2471 patients seen at the authors' center, 68 patients (3 percent) with bilateral facial paralysis were identified. Ten patients (15 percent) presented with bilateral facial paralysis caused by Lyme disease, nine (13 percent) with M‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√ábius syndrome, nine (13 percent) with neurofibromatosis type 2, five (7 percent) with bilateral facial palsy caused by brain tumor, four (6 percent) with Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, three (4 percent) with bilateral temporal bone fractures, two (3 percent) with Guillain-Barr‚Äö√†√∂¬¨¬© syndrome, one (2 percent) with central nervous system lymphoma, one (2 percent) with human immunodeficiency virus infection, and 24 (35 percent) with presumed Bell palsy. Treatment included pharmacologic therapy, physical therapy, chemodenervation, and surgical interventions.

When the facial nerve is transected or severely compromised and primary end-to-end repair is not possible, hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis remains the most popular method for accomplishing three main goals: restoring facial tone, restoring facial symmetry, and facilitating return of voluntary facial movement. Our objectives are to evaluate the surgical feasibility and long-term outcomes of our technique of direct facial-to-hypoglossal neurorrhaphy with a parotid-release maneuver. Design: Prospective cohort. Setting: Academic tertiary care referral center. Patients: Ten patients with facial paralysis from proximal nerve injury underwent the facial-hypoglossal neurorrhaphy with a parotid-release maneuver. Main outcome measures: The Repaired Facial Nerve Recovery Scale, questionnaires, and photographs. Results: Facial-hypoglossal neurorrhaphy with parotid release was technically feasible in all cases, and anastomosis was performed distal to the origin of the ansa hypoglossi. All patients had good return of facial nerve function. Nine patients had scores of C or better, indicating strong eyelid and oral sphincter closure and mass motion. There was no hemilingual atrophy and no subjective tongue dysfunction. Conclusions: The parotid-release maneuver mobilizes additional length to the facial nerve, facilitating a tensionless communication distal to the ansa hypoglossi. The technique is a viable option for facial reanimation, and our patients achieved good clinical outcomes with continual improvement.},

	abstract = {Introduction: M‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√ábius syndrome is defined as a combined congenital bilateral facial and abducens nerve palsies. The main goal of treatment is to provide facial reanimation by means of a dynamic surgical procedure. The microneurovascular transfer of a free muscle transplant is the procedure of choice for facial animation in a child with facial paralysis. Observation: Between January 2008 and January 2017, 124 patients with the syndrome have been approached at our institution. Distribution according to M‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√ábius Syndrome classification presents as follows: Complete M‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√ábius syndrome (n=88), Incomplete M‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√ábius syndrome (n=28), M‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√ábius-Like syndrome (n=8). Seventy-nine female and 45 male patients. Sixty-one percent have undergone a microsurgical procedure (n=76), in all of them, a free gracilis flap transfer was performed. Discussion: Our proposed treatment protocol for complete M‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√ábius syndrome is determined by the available donor nerves. We prefer to use the masseteric nerve as first choice, however, if this nerve is not available, then our second choice is the spinal accesory nerve. For this purpose, all patients have an electromyography performed preoperatively. Overall, dynamic facial reanimation obtained through the microvascular transfer of the gracilis muscle have proved to improve notoriously oral comissure excursion and speech intelligibility. Conclusion: The free gracilis flap transfer is a reproducible procedure for patients with M‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√ábius syndrome. It is of utmost importance to select the best motor nerve possible, based on an individualized preoperative clinical and electromyographic evaluation. To our best knowledge, this is the largest series of patients with M‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√ábius syndrome globally, treated at a single-institution.},

	abstract = {Gracilis functioning free-muscle transplantation for the correction of pure facial paralysis has been a preferred method used by many reconstructive microsurgeons. However, for complex facial paralysis, the deficits include facial paralysis along with soft-tissue, mucosa, and/or skin defects. No adequate solution has been proposed. Treatment requests in those patients are not only for facial reanimation but also for correction of the defects. Of 161 patients with facial paralysis treated with gracilis functioning free-muscle transplantation from 1986 to 2002, eight patients (5 percent) presented with complex deficits requiring not only facial reanimation but also aesthetic correction of tissue defects. The tissue defects included an intraoral defect created following contracture release (one patient), infra-auricular radiation dermatitis with contour depression (one patient), temporal depression following a temporalis muscle-fascia transfer (one patient), ear deformity (two patients), and infra-auricular atrophic tissue with contour depression (three patients). A compound flap, consisting of a gracilis muscle with its overlying skin paddle separated into two components, was transferred for simultaneous correction of both problems. The blood supply to the gracilis and to the skin paddle originated from the same source vessel and therefore required the anastomosis of only one set of vessels. The versatility of this compound flap allows for a wide arc of rotation of the skin paddle around the muscle. All flaps were transferred successfully without complications. Satisfactory results of facial reanimation were recorded in five patients after all stages were completed. The remaining three patients are undergoing physical therapy and waiting for revision of the skin paddle.},

However, these complex procedures sometimes result in cheek bulkiness owing to the double muscle transfer. We present the case of a 67-year-old woman with long-standing facial paralysis, who underwent two-stage facial reanimation using two superficial subslips of the serratus anterior muscle innervated by the masseteric and contralateral facial nerves via a sural nerve graft. Each muscle subslip was transferred to the upper lip and oral commissures, which were oriented in different directions. Furthermore, a horizontal fascia lata graft was added at the lower lip to prevent deformities such as lower lip elongation and deviation. Voluntary contraction was noted at roughly 4 months, and a spontaneous smile without biting was noted 8 months postoperatively. At 18 months after surgery, the patient demonstrated a spontaneous symmetrical smile with adequate excursion of the lower lip, upper lip, and oral commissure, without cheek bulkiness. Dual-innervated muscle transfer using two multivector superficial subslips of the serratus anterior muscle may be a good option for long-standing facial paralysis, as it can achieve a symmetrical smile that can be performed voluntarily and spontaneously.},

Linear mixed-effect models were used to investigate the effects of assessor and patient factors on esthetic outcome assessments, to examine changes after smile reanimation, and to determine whether sex and age explained part of the esthetic outcomes.Fifty-eight percent of variation in the esthetic scores can be explained by some assessors being more positive in their esthetic scoring compared to other assessors.

This first clinical series of masseteric-thoracodorsal-facial nerve neurorrhaphies has given encouraging results, and the technique should be considered as an option for immediate or recent reconstruction of branches of the facial nerve, particularly when its trunk is not available for proximal neurorrhaphy.},

	title = {Temporalis pull-through vs fascia lata augmentation in facial reanimation for facial paralysis},
	abstract = {Objectives: Surgical rehabilitation of facial palsy is challenging as each case is unique and success rate is often unpredictable. In one technique, temporalis is elevated from origin preserving vessels, and this elevation increases the length which is tunneled into buccal tissues (pull-through technique, Group A). In the other technique, a harvested fascia lata is attached to temporalis after a coronoidectomy release and the fascia lata is attached to the modiolus (Group B). The aim of this study is to compare the two different surgical techniques. Materials and methods: Case records of 22 cases, 15 females, and 7 males who were operated between 2008 and 2012 for facial palsy with at least 1-year follow-up, using either of the techniques were assessed for pull of muscle, postoperative pain, recovery time, motor control, and symmetry at rest. Descriptive statistics are presented. Results: The Group A (n = 7) and Group B (n = 15) formed the study group. In the Group A, residual asymmetry (n = 3), poor postoperative muscle pull (n = 2) were noticed while in the modified group it was 2 and 3, respectively. The technique used in Group B had better pull of muscle, symmetry, faster recovery time, and better motor control at 1-year follow-up than the conventional technique. Discussion and conclusion: The difference between the two groups is due to preservation of original muscular architecture, vascular channel supply. As the muscle is not traumatized, no fibrosis occurs aiding regaining of normal function. In addition, the facial reanimation is more successful in the Group B. The mechanism and success behind the technique used in Group B is discussed elaborately in terms of localregional anatomy and physiology.},

	title = {Facial {Palsy}, {Radiographic} and {Other} {Workup} {Negative}: {FROWN}},
	abstract = {Objectives: Slow-onset peripheral facial palsy is far less common than acute-onset peripheral facial palsy and necessitates diagnostic evaluation for benign or malignant tumors or other less common etiologies. In the rare scenario in which no clarifying etiology is discovered following long-term evaluation (no radiographic or hematologic abnormalities and an otherwise unremarkable evaluation), a diagnostic and management dilemma occurs. We present a series of patients with this possible new clinical entity: Facial palsy, Radiographic and Other Workup Negative (FROWN) and propose a management strategy for this diagnosis of exclusion. Methods: A series of 3,849 patients presenting with facial palsy to a tertiary facial nerve center was retrospectively assessed to identify those with progressive loss of facial function over at least 1 month. Exclusion criteria were history, physical or hematologic findings indicative of known diseases associated with facial palsy, and radiographic studies demonstrating a benign or malignant tumor. Results: Patients with slow-onset facial palsy constituted 5\% (190 patients) of the cohort and were ultimately diagnosed with either a benign or malignant neoplasm or other facial nerve pathology. Fourteen patients with slow-onset facial palsy remained without a diagnosis following long-term evaluation and serial imaging. Eleven patients underwent dynamic facial reanimation surgery and facial nerve and muscle biopsy, with no clear histopathologic diagnosis. Conclusion: Patients with slow-onset facial palsy with negative radiographic and medical evaluations over several years may be characterized as having FROWN, an idiopathic and as yet poorly understood condition, which appears to be amenable to facial reanimation but requires further investigation as to its pathophysiology.},

	abstract = {Background: Moebius syndrome, a rare congenital disorder of varying severity, involves multiple cranial nerves and is characterized predominantly by bilateral or unilateral paralysis of the facial and abducens nerves. The paralysis of the VI and VII cranial nerves leads to a lack of function in the muscles they supply. Facial paralysis often causes bilabial incompetence with speech difficulties, oral incompetence, problems with eating and drinking, including pocketing of food in the cheek and dribbling, as well as severe drooling. Methods: In this study, we report on pediatric patients with Moebius and Moebius-like syndromes seen and treated surgically from 2003 to September 2007 at the Operative Unit of Maxillofacial Surgery, Head and Neck Department, University of Parma, Italy. Results: Twelve patients underwent microsurgical reconstruction for restoration of facial movement. The contralateral facial nerve was used as a motor donor nerve in 4 procedures, the motor nerve to the masseter muscle was used in 8 patients, and the gracilis muscle was used in all operations, with a total of 17 free-muscle transplantations. All free-muscle transplantations survived transfer, and no flap was lost. We observed a significant improvement in drooling, drinking, speech, and facial animation with a high degree of patient satisfaction. Conclusions: The gracilis muscle free transfer is a surgical procedure well tolerated by the young patients and well accepted by their families. We consider it a safe and reliable technique for facial reanimation with good aesthetical and functional results in children with Moebius and Moebius-like syndromes.},

@article{terzis_jk_babysitter_2009,
	title = {The "babysitter" procedure: minihypoglossal to facial nerve transfer and cross-facial nerve grafting},
	abstract = {Background: In 1984, Terzis introduced the "babysitter" procedure, a new concept in facial reanimation. It involves two stages, with coaptation of ipsilateral 40 percent hypoglossal to facial nerve on the affected side, performed concomitantly with cross-facial nerve grafting and secondary microcoaptations 8 to 15 months later. This article presents the senior author's (J.K.T.) experience with the original procedure. Methods: Of 75 patients who had minihypoglossal nerve transfer, 20 fulfilled the selection criteria for the original babysitter procedure. All patients' records, photographs, videotapes, and needle electromyography studies were reviewed. The clinical results were scored using Terzis' Grading Scale. Eye closure, smile, and lower lip depression were each assessed separately. Functional and aesthetic outcomes and preoperative and postoperative electromyography results were analyzed. Results: Seventy-five percent of patients achieved excellent and good results, 15 percent had moderate results, and 10 percent had fair results. The difference between preoperative and postoperative eye closure was statistically significant (t test, p {\textless} 0.001). Symmetrical smile and full contraction (excellent result) was achieved in two patients (10 percent), 13 patients (65 percent) had nearly symmetrical smile (good result), and five patients (25 percent) had a moderate result. Two patients (10 percent) had full lower lip depression (excellent result) and 15 (75 percent) had good results. In three patients (15 percent), subsequent digastric or platysma muscle transfer was performed because of inadequate depression and symmetry (moderate result). A statistically significant difference was observed between preoperative and postoperative electromyography results, in eye closure, smile, and lower lip depression. Conclusions: The original babysitter procedure offers significant improvement in selected patients with facial paralysis. Symmetry and coordinated movements can be restored, with satisfying aesthetic and functional outcomes.},

	abstract = {A direct communication between the glossopharyngeal and facial nerves known as Haller's ansa exists in a minority of patients. Clinical manifestations of this anastomosis are not commonly observed. We describe post-operative facial movement with swallowing after facial nerve sacrifice in two patients who underwent surgery for skull base tumors. Patient 1, a 49-year-old male, received a transcochlear approach for resection of endolymphatic sac tumor and intratemporal facial nerve sacrifice without nerve reconstruction. Patient 2, a 23-year-old female, underwent surgery for left jugular paraganglioma, requiring facial nerve sacrifice and cable graft. Both patients had preoperative facial weakness and intraoperative preservation of the glossopharyngeal nerve. A literature review related to Haller's ansa was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus from 1920-2021. Post-operatively, both patients demonstrated oral commissure movement with swallowing, suggesting a communication between the glossopharyngeal nerve and the facial nerve (Haller's ansa). Although anatomical references to Haller's ansa exist, there are no reported clinical manifestations of this neural anastomosis. Glossopharyngeal-facial nerve communications may contribute to facial tone and movement. Pre- and post-operative assessment of facial nerve movement with swallowing may help assess for the presence of Haller's ansa. Better understanding of this neural anastomosis may have implications for facial reanimation surgery. Laryngoscope, 2021.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Facial palsy is a debilitating condition entailing both cosmetic and functional limitations. Static suspension procedures can be performed when more advanced dynamic techniques are not indicated. Since 2006, we have used a double-layered palmaris longus tendon graft through an ovular skin excision in the nasolabial fold for access. The aim of this paper is to present our surgical technique and case series. Methods: This study was a retrospective case series in a university hospital setting. All patients who had this procedure performed were included before August 2013. Data from electronic patient records were retrieved, patients were invited for a follow-up visit and results were measured using the Lip Reanimation Outcomes Questionnaire. Furthermore, standardised photographs were taken and evaluated by multiple surgeons. Results: A total of 13 patients were included with a mean follow-up of 49 months (range: 3-89 months). 93\% noted an improvement of their facial appearance at follow-up. Seven out of 11 patients with preoperative problems with speech noted an improvement at follow-up. Eight out of 12 patients with preoperative problems with oral competence noted an improvement at follow-up. Photographic evaluation revealed an acceptable symmetry at rest with an increasing asymmetry with increasing smile intensity. No post-operative complications or donor site morbidity was noted in any of our patients. Conclusion: Our technique is easy to perform with no noteworthy complications, and it improves the quality of life of patients with facial palsy. It is an acceptable alternative when more advanced procedures are not indicated. Funding: not relevant. Trial registration: not relevant.},

	title = {The degree of facial movement following microvascular muscle transfer in pediatric facial reanimation depends on donor motor nerve axonal density},
	abstract = {Background: Free functional muscle transfer to the face is a standard of facial animation. The contralateral facial nerve, via a cross-face nerve graft, provides spontaneous innervation for the transferred muscle, but is not universally available and has additional shortcomings. The motor nerve to the masseter provides an alternative innervation source. In this study, the authors compared donor nerve histomorphometry and clinical outcomes in a single patient population undergoing free muscle transfer to the face. Methods: Pediatric patients undergoing dynamic facial (re-)animation with intraoperative nerve biopsies and gracilis transfer to the face powered by either the contralateral facial nerve via a cross-face nerve graft or the motor nerve to the masseter were reviewed over a 7-year period. Myelinated nerve counts were assessed histomorphometrically, and functional outcomes were evaluated with the Scaled Measurement of Improvement in Lip Excursion software. Results: From 2004 to 2011, 91 facial (re-)animation procedures satisfied study inclusion criteria. Average myelinated fiber counts were 6757 per mm2 in the donor facial nerve branch, 1647 per mm in the downstream cross-face nerve graft at the second stage, and 5289 per mm in the masseteric nerve. Reconstructions with either innervation source resulted in improvements in oral commissure excursion and smile symmetry, with the greatest amounts of oral commissure excursion noted in the masseteric nerve group. Conclusions: Facial (re-)animation procedures with use of the cross-face nerve graft or masseteric nerve are effective and result in symmetric smiles. The masseteric nerve provides a more robust innervation source and results in greater commissure excursion. Clinical question/level of evidence: Therapeutic, III.},

Study design: Population-based long-term analysis for all new primary parotid carcinoma cases in Thuringia from 1996 to 2019. Methods: Data of the cancer registries of Thuringia, a federal state in Germany, were analyzed in combination with hospital-based data on facial function. Results: About 477 patients (42.3\% women; median age: 68 years) were included. It was observed that 6.7\% had a preoperative facial nerve dysfunction, 11.7\% received a radical parotidectomy, that is, that 5\% had a normal preoperative facial function but needed radical surgery because of intraoperative detection of tumor infiltration into the facial nerve. About 10.2\% received facial nerve reconstruction surgery. Immediate postoperative facial nerve dysfunction in the other patients was observed in 34.4\% of the patients. Advanced T classification (odds ratio [OR] = 2.140; confidence interval [CI] = 1.268-3.611; P = .004) and neck dissection (OR = 2.012; CI = 1.027-3.940; P = .041) were independent risk factors for immediate postoperative facial nerve dysfunction. In addition, 22.0\% showed no recovery during follow-up. Advanced T classification (OR = 2.177; CI = 1.147-4.133; P = .017) and postoperative radiotherapy (OR = 2.695; CI = 1.244-5.841; P = .012) were independent risk factors for permanent postoperative facial nerve dysfunction. Conclusion: Patients with primary parotid cancer are at high risk for long-term facial nerve dysfunction.

The principle of this method is that the sling around the muscle pulls the oral commissure laterally and backward by the restoring force of the muscle from its relaxed position to its contracted position. The surgical procedure is simple. The sling is passed around the anterior half of the muscle so that the muscle can be bowed anteriorly at its center by the sling. One end of the sling is sutured to the center of the orbicularis oris and the dermis in front of the nasolabial fold, and the other end is sutured to the lower lip and oral commissure. This method was applied to 3 patients with facial palsy and to 1 patient with oral cancer. The restored motion of the oral commissure ranged from 5 to 8 mm when clenching the jaws. The concept of this method differs from those of other muscle transposition methods for facial reanimation in that the force acts at a right angle to the muscle contraction. The advantage of this method is that it is less invasive to the muscle and is a simpler procedure than other conventional muscle transposition methods.},

	abstract = {Objectives: In patients with facial paralysis, facial reanimation surgery may be needed to normalize facial soft tissue function/movements. Critical for this normalization is the dynamics of the nasolabial folds (NLFs). The objective of this prospective, observational study was to determine the 3D morphologic dynamics of the NLFs in patients with unilateral facial palsy and normal subjects. Settings and sample population: 3D facial soft tissue movement data collected from adults with unilateral, facial paralysis (Bell's Palsy, n = 36); and (2) an age- and sex-frequency matched control group (n = 68). Materials and methods: Movement data were collected during repeated animations from participants using a video-based motion capture system. Movement in terms of displacement and asymmetry of the NLFs, nasal and circumoral regions were analyzed in the lateral, vertical and depth planes; as well as movement of the commissure and NLFs relative to the lower lip midline. Two-sample t tests were used to test for significant group differences. Results: Patients NLFs had less mean displacement, greater mean asymmetry and uncoordinated movements compared with the controls. For both groups during smiling, the NLF and commissure landmarks had approximately similar magnitudes of displacement (control range = 11-14mm; patient range = 7-10mm). Conclusion: NLF dynamics during smiling were as significant as oral commissure excursion. Thus, an immobile NLF is an unnatural feature of facial animations. Surgical treatments that address impaired NFL movements must be considered to create a more natural surgical outcome especially during smiling.},

	abstract = {Free muscle flap transfer is currently the procedure of choice for longstanding facial paralysis to restore symmetry both at rest and when smiling. However, movements obtained are generally localized, unidirectional, and philtrum centralization and lower lip movement is not proportionally achieved. The stability of free flap insertion at the lips also interferes with the results, as gradual disinsertion and shifting of the nasolabial fold can be caused by repetitive movements. Asymmetry of smile can also be caused by lip depressor inactivity due to marginal mandibular paralysis, and both dynamic and static procedures are often required after dynamic reanimation. Here, the authors report a technical refinement that can be used even years after facial reanimation, using concealed scars and with minimal morbidity for correction of static and dynamic labial deviations from the midline. Placement of a transfixed tendon graft in C-fashion tendon graft between the gracilis free flap and the orbicularis oris of the upper and lower lip on the nonparalyzed side allows the forces from muscle contraction to be transferred to the philtrum and lower lip. It allows correction of static and dynamic labial deviations from the midline, reducing rates of inadequate fixation and partial or total disinsertion of the muscle flap in the buccal region.},

	abstract = {Background: The hypoglossal (with or without grafts) and masseter nerves are frequently used as axon donors for facial reinnervation when no proximal stump of the facial nerve is available. We report our experience treating facial nerve palsies via hemihypoglossal-to-facial nerve transfers either with (HFG) or without grafts (HFD), comparing these outcomes against those of masseteric-to-facial nerve transfers (MF). Method: A total of 77 patients were analyzed retrospectively, including 51 HFD, 11 HFG, and 15 MF nerve transfer patients. Both the House-Brackmann (HB) scale and our own, newly-designed scale to rate facial reanimation post nerve transfer (quantifying symmetry at rest and when smiling, eye occlusion, and eye and mouth synkinesis when speaking) were used to enumerate the extent of recovery. Results: With both the HB and our own facial reanimation scale, the HFD and MF procedures yielded better outcome scores than HFG, though only the HGD was statistically superior. HGD produced slightly better scores than MF for everything but eye synkinesis, but these differences were generally not statistically significant. Delaying surgery beyond 2 years since injury was associated with appreciably worse outcomes when measured with our own but not the HB scale. The only predictors of outcome were the surgical technique employed and the duration of time between the initial injury and surgery. Conclusions: HFD appears to produce the most satisfactory facial reanimation results, with MF providing lesser but still satisfactory outcomes. Using interposed grafts while performing hemihypoglossal-to-facial nerve transfers should likely be avoided, whenever possible.},

Intervention: The patient received 30 sessions of physical therapy that included electrical stimulation, biofeedback, lymphatic drainage, home exercises and facial stretching, and scar management. Outcomes: The patient exhibited an improvement in the Composite score of the Sunnybrook Facial Grading System from 17 to 41. She was able to regain function of the left side of her face with gains in expressions of smiling, frowning, and puckering, but symmetry was not completely restored. The patient had chronic difficulty with left-sided lymphedema, requiring frequent manual lymphatic drainage. Discussion: Data from this case study suggest that physical therapy management improves functional outcomes for individuals with postoperative changes in facial motor function from facial reanimation surgery. Further research is required to explore factors that influence the rate and extent of recovery derived from physical therapy interventions.},

	abstract = {Background: MiDFace reanimation in patients with chronic facial paralysis is not always possible with an ipsilateral or contralateral facial nerve innervating a free neuromuscular tissue transfer. Alternate use of nonfacial nerves is occasionally indicated but may potentially result in inadvertent motions. The goal of this study was to objectively review videos of patients who underwent one-stage reanimation with a gracilis muscle transfer innervated by the masseteric nerve for (1) inadvertent motion during eating, (2) characterization of masticatory patterns, and (3) social hindrance perceived by the patients during meals. Methods: Between the years 2009 and 2012, 18 patients underwent miDFacial reanimation with partial gracilis muscle transfer coapted to the masseter nerve for treatment of miDFacial paralysis. Sixteen patients were videotaped in detail while eating. Involuntary miDFace movement on the reconstructed side and mastication patterns were assessed. In addition, 16 patients were surveyed as to whether involuntary motion constituted a problem in their daily lives. Results: All 16 patients videotaped during mastication demonstrated involuntary motion on the reconstructed side while eating. Several unique masticatory patterns were noted as well. Only one of the 16 patients reported involuntary motion as a minor disturbance in daily life during meals. Conclusions: All patients with chronic facial paralysis who plan to undergo miDFace reanimation with a free tissue transfer innervated by the ipsilateral masseter nerve should be told that they would universally have involuntary animation during mastication. Most patients do not consider this a major drawback in their daily lives. Clinical question/level of evidence: Therapeutic, IV.},

	abstract = {Background: Wide resection of tumors of the middle third of the face often results in complex three-dimensional defects and facial paralysis either due to removal of the facial nerve within the tumoral tissue or to extensive resection of the facial muscles. Methods: We report the cases of three patients who underwent wide excision of tumors of the cheek region, operations that resulted in tissue defects and facial palsy. Defect reconstruction and facial reanimation was accomplished in one stage through functional muscle transplantation. Results: Follow-up of more than 1 year showed good symmetry at rest and reanimation of the corner of the mouth in all cases, but one patient, in which the ipsilateral facial main trunk was used as motor nerve supply to the transplanted muscle, developed significant muscle contracture and binding of the cheek skin. Conclusions: Every effort should be made to optimize the functional and cosmetic outcomes of neurovascular muscle transfers through precise planning and careful execution of the intricate details of the surgical technique for muscle transplantation.},

Patients and methods: Retrospective review at a single tertiary health care system (January 1, 1990, through December 31, 2015), evaluating 80 consecutive patients with sporadic FNS. Results: Ninety-eight patients with FNS were identified; 10 with incomplete data and 8 with neurofibromatosis type 2 were excluded. The remaining 80 patients (median age, 47 years; 58\% women) were analyzed. Forty-three (54\%) patients presented with asymmetrical hearing loss, 33 (41\%) reported facial paresis, and 21 (26\%) reported facial spasm. Seventeen (21\%) exhibited radiologic features mimicking vestibular schwannoma, 14 (18\%) presented as a parotid mass, and 5 (6\%) were discovered incidentally. Factors predictive of facial nerve paresis or spasm before treatment were female sex and tumor involvement of the labyrinthine/geniculate and tympanic facial nerve segments. The median growth rate among growing FNS was 2.0 mm/y. Details regarding clinical outcome according to treatment modality are described. Conclusion: In patients with FNS, female sex and involvement of the labyrinthine/geniculate and tympanic segments of the facial nerve predict a higher probability of facial paresis or spasm. When isolated to the posterior fossa or parotid gland, establishing a preoperative diagnosis of FNS is challenging. Treatment should be tailored according to tumor location and size, existing facial nerve function, patient priorities, and age. A management algorithm is presented, prioritizing long-term facial nerve function.},

	abstract = {Background: Suprazygomatic aponeurotic McLaughlin (SAM) myoplasty technique for facial reanimation is based on the classical McLauglin's lengthening temporalis myoplasty with a series of new modifications. A comprehensive review of previously described other orthodromic temporalis myoplasty techniques is also included to give a succinct comparison. Methods: Twelve adult patients of facial palsy underwent SAM myoplasty for a period of 4 years. Three had congenital facial palsy, 4 patients had facial palsy secondary to acoustic neuromas, 3 were posttraumatic, and 2 patients had Bell's palsy. Results: Range of modiolus excursion achieved as measured at 3 months postoperatively on reanimation in our patients was 5 mm to 20 mm with an average of 12.6 mm. With SAM myoplasty technique, we were able to achieve excellent result in 4 patients and good results in 8 patients as evaluated with May and Druker scoring system. Conclusions: Suprazygomatic aponeurotic McLaughlin myoplasty for facial reanimation demonstrates a successful modification of the classical McLaughlin lengthening temporalis myoplasty, making it more customizable, simple, and predictable by taking the level of transection to the temporalis aponeurosis without the need for zygomatic osteotomy. A new classification of orthodromic temporalis myoplasty based on level of transections is also proposed for the first time. Good to excellent outcomes coupled with high patient satisfaction and low morbidity should make this technique popular among the facial reanimation surgeons.},

It is an important disability both from the aesthetic and functional points of view. Between 2003 and 2008, at the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery, University of Parma, Italy, 21 patients with facial paralysis had their faces reanimated with a gracilis transplant reinnervated by the masseter motor nerve. All free-muscle transplants survived the transfer, and no flap was lost. Facial symmetry at rest and while smiling was excellent or good in most cases, and we found an appreciable improvement in both speech and oral competence. We consider that the masseter motor nerve is a powerful and reliable donor nerve, which allows us to obtain movement of the commissure and upper lip similar to those of the normal site for degree and direction. There may be a role for the masseter motor nerve in innervation of patients with facial paralysis.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Facial palsy is a condition where the patients lack voluntary movement on the affected side of the face and are not able to convey their emotions. Besides that, they also succumb themselves to social isolation. Various techniques have been devised to overcome this devastating problem. The aim of this article is to evaluate and compare facial muscle function before and after facial reanimation with temporalis muscle galea pedicled flap by motion mode echomyography in patients with long-standing facial paralysis. Patients and methods: Ten patients with long-standing facial paralysis were included in the study (six patients with LMN palsy and four patients with facial weakness involving specific peripheral branches), and they subsequently underwent facial reanimation surgery with temporalis galea pedicled flap. These patients were followed postoperatively for a period of 1-2 years and were subjectively graded as excellent, good, fair and poor and objectively evaluated by M-mode echomyography, and the results were evaluated and statistically analyzed. Results: Subjectively, out of 6 patients with LMN palsy, results were graded as excellent in 2 cases, good in 3 cases, fair in 1 case, and out of 4 patients with weakness in specific facial nerve branches, the subjective results were excellent in 2 cases, good in 1 case and fair in 1 case. Objectively, the effect of transposed temporalis galea on orbicularis occuli, levator labii superioris and orbicularis oris was found to be statistically significant in patients with LMN palsy. Conclusion: Our study proves the versatility of temporalis muscle galea pedicled flap in cases of long-standing facial paralysis by motion mode echomyography.},

	abstract = {Objectives/hypothesis: To quantify the threshold for human perception of asymmetry for eyebrow elevation, eye closure, and smile, and to ascertain whether asymmetry detection thresholds and perceived severity of asymmetry differ in distinct facial zones. Study design: Online survey. Methods: Photographs of a female volunteer performing eyebrow elevation, eye closure, and smile were digitally manipulated to introduce left-to-right asymmetry in 1-mm increments from 0 mm to 6 mm. One hundred and forty-five participants viewed these photographs using an online survey, measuring accuracy of asymmetry detection and perceived expression unnaturalness (on a scale of 1-5). Results: Photographs of facial asymmetries were correctly judged as asymmetrical over 90\% of the time for 2 mm or more of asymmetry in eyelid closure, and 3 mm or more of asymmetry during smiling. Identification of eyebrow elevation asymmetry gradually rose from 23\% correct to 97\% correct across the range of 1 mm to 6 mm of asymmetry. Greater degrees of asymmetry were ranked as significantly more unnatural across all expressions (3 tests; X(2) (6, N = 145) = 405.52 to 656.27, all P {\textless}0.001). Conclusion: Thresholds for asymmetry detection vary across different zones of the face; once detected, asymmetry in eyelid position is perceived as more unnatural than asymmetries in either brow elevation or smile. These data will inform counseling of patients with segmental facial weakness and may provide more objective goals for facial reanimation procedures. Level of evidence: 4.},

Introduced by Terzis in 1984, the technique can produce satisfactory to excellent results. In long-lasting paralysis, nonetheless, the babysitter procedure may need to be combined with a muscle(s) flap(s) for outcome upgrading, which was the focus of the present study. Methods: Thirty-eight patients had the babysitter procedure over a 20-year period (1984 to 2003). Twenty patients had only the babysitter procedure, whereas 18 needed an additional muscle flap(s) (up to three) to enhance function and cosmesis. These muscles included nine free (gracilis, pectoralis minor) and 20 regional (frontalis, minitemporalis, platysma, digastric) muscles for distinct target needs: eye closure, smile restoration, and lower lip depression. The need for a muscle flap was determined at the initial consultation. All free muscles were transferred at the second-stage of the babysitter procedure, whereas regional muscles were also transposed later. Three independent observers graded the results at two time intervals, preoperatively and 2 years after all operations were completed. Results: The average postoperative grading scores were significantly higher compared with preoperative scores for eye closure, smile, lower lip depression, and overall aesthetic outcome (p {\textless} 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed ranks test). All patients had upgrading of overall aesthetics and smile, whereas four maintained similar scoring for eye closure and one maintained similar scoring for lip depression. All but two had secondary procedures to further enhance facial symmetry. Conclusion: The babysitter procedure in conjunction with muscle transfers in selected patients with late presentation can provide highly satisfactory results when seeking uncompromising outcome.},

Study design: A retrospective review of patients undergoing facial nerve repair from 1963-1997. Methods: One hundred and three patients underwent surgical intervention designed to repair a disrupted facial nerve. All procedures were performed by one of the senior surgeons (M.M.) Seventy-two patients had a complete data set and at least one year of follow-up. Results: Eighty percent of patients attained an outcome considered superb to fair. Twenty percent of patients had a poor outcome. There was a slight worsening of outcome with increased time to repair. Patients with a neoplastic etiology of nerve paralysis tended to have a worse outcome. Conclusions: Facial nerve grafting is most successful if intervention is undertaken at or near the time of initial injury. However, prolonged time (up to two years) to repair does not preclude the potential for some recovery. The limitations of the current systems for grading facial recovery after nerve repair are well known, and the adoption of a new grading scale for assessing recovery after reanimation procedure is recommended.},

The masseteric-to-facial nerve transfer (MFNT) has many advantages in facial reanimation. The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of our MFNT technique and define the potential factors predictive of outcome. The authors conducted a retrospective review of 20 consecutive patients who underwent MFNT using the temporofacial trunk of facial nerve. Videotapes and images were documented and evaluated according to Facial Nerve Grading Scale 2.0 (FNGS2.0) and Sunnybrook Facial Grading System (FGS). The quality-of-life was obtained using the Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE) Scale. Moreover, Facial Asymmetry Index (FAI), quantitative measurement of the width of palpebral fissure, deviation of the philtrum, and angles or excursions of the oral commissure were applied to explore the effect of the transfer metrically. Multivariable logistic regression models and Cox regression were prepared to predict the effect of MFNT by preoperative clinical features. The patients showed favorable outcomes graded by FNGS2.0, and experienced significantly improved scores in static and dynamic symmetry with slightly elevated scores in synkinesis evaluated by the Sunnybrook FGS. The score of FaCE Scale increased in all domains after reanimation. The quantitative indices indicated the symmetry restoration of the middle and lower face after MFNT. Regression analysis revealed that younger patients with severe facial paralysis are preferable to receive MFNT early for faster and better recovery, especially for traumatic causes. The findings demonstrate that MFNT is an effective technique for facial reanimation, and case screening based on clinical characteristics could be useful for surgical recommendation.},

In our Department, the endoscopic endonasal transphenoidal surgery (EETS) has been performed regularly for anterior and middle cranial fossa lesions, and FL graft has commonly been a practical resource in repairing tissue defects after EETS.Enough, we used routinely harvesting FL to restore symmetry in facial palsy. To our known, this is the biggest case series about FL harvesting to repare tissue defects after EET. The purpose of our study was to evaluate our experience with the harvesting of FL, in particularly the donor site morbidity.

Facial reanimation procedures differ in their ability to restore a spontaneous smile, and an assay designed to evoke and evaluate a spontaneous smile is not available. Objective: To develop and validate an assay to assess the spontaneous smile of patients with facial paralysis. Design, setting, and participants: This was an exploratory cohort study. A series of short video clips were administered to laypersons via an online survey service from January 1, 2014, to March 31, 2014. Respondents rated how funny each video was on a visual analog scale from 0 to 100. The 4 funniest videos were selected to generate a 1¬¨¬®≈í¬©-minute spontaneous smile assay. The assay was then administered from July 1, 2014, to December 31, 2014, to 2 different study groups: the first was composed of 100 healthy individuals (control group) and the second was composed of 30 patients with facial paralysis. We analyzed the capability of this assay to provoke at least 1 spontaneous smile and calculated smile excursion in both groups. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance. Intervention: Spontaneous smile assay administered to both healthy and diseased groups. Main outcomes and measures: Ability of the assay to elicit smiles, as defined by an oral commissure excursion greater than 3 mm, as well as difference in commissure excursion. Results: Ninety-five (95.0\%) participants in the control group and 29 (96.7\%) patients with facial paralysis experienced at least 1 oral commissure excursion that appeared to be a spontaneous smile while viewing the assay. Mean oral commissure excursion with spontaneous smile was 9.08 mm (95\% CI, 2.77-15.39) in controls, 6.72 mm (95\% CI, 3.13-10.31) on the healthy side in patients with flaccid facial paralysis (P=.004 vs controls), and 9.64 mm (95\% CI, 3.52-15.76) on the healthy side in patients with nonflaccid facial paralysis (P=.74). Among patients with flaccid facial paralysis, a statistically significant difference was found between smile excursion of the affected and the unaffected sides (P = .03). There was no statistically significant difference in the measurement between sides for the control group (P = .67). Conclusions and relevance: Although humor is a challenging construct to universalize, our assay was able to elicit a smile in almost all individuals in the group with facial paralysis and the control group. The spontaneous smile assay will facilitate future research on the ability of facial reanimation procedures and other interventions to restore a spontaneous smile. Level of evidence: NA.},

	abstract = {Background: Facial paralysis can drastically diminish satisfaction in one's social interactions and overall quality of life. Bell palsy is the most common cause of facial palsy, however, a diagnosis of "atypical" BP may originate from an entirely different pathological process. This case highlights a rare case of facial nerve paraganglioma, initially misdiagnosed as BP, that resulted in facial paralysis from neoplastic invasion of the facial nerve. Case presentation: A 66-year old Hispanic woman with systemic lupus erythematosus presented to the plastic surgery clinic with complaints of drooling and being unable to smile. She experienced several episodes of left facial paralysis and was diagnosed with BP at an outside institution. Each episode was only partially responsive to steroid therapy. Imaging at our institution demonstrated lobulated enhancement along the vertical and extratemporal segments of the facial nerve, which prompted surgical intervention. The patient underwent left transmastoid approach for removal of the lesion involving the facial nerve followed by facial nerve reanimation via gracilis free flap without complication. Conclusions: This report outlines an extraordinarily rare case of a patient with facial nerve paraganglioma. This case represents the importance of reconstructive surgeons in considering a thorough diagnostic work-up with imaging and histopathology in the setting of idiopathic facial paralysis. Successful collaboration between otolaryngology and plastic surgery made streamlined diagnosis and surgical treatment of this unique case possible.},

	title = {Reconstruction of complex defects of the extracranial facial nerve: technique of "the trifurcation approach"},
	abstract = {Purpose: Reconstruction of complex defects of facial nerve (FN) after extensive cancer surgery requires individualized solutions. We describe the trifurcation technique as a modification of the combined approach on example of two patients with locally advanced parotid cancer. Methods: Due to perineural invasion, extensive resection of the FN from the mastoid segment to the peripheral branches was required. For reanimation of the upper face, a complex cervical plexus graft was sutured end-to-end to the mastoid segment of the FN trunk. The branches of the graft enabled reanimation of three peripheral temporal and zygomatic branches. The mandibular branch was sutured end-to-side to the hypoglossal nerve (hypoglossal-facial nerve transfer, HFNT). Additionally, the buccal branch was independently reanimated with ansa cervicalis. Results: Facial reanimation was successful in both patients. Good resting tone and voluntary movement were achieved with a mild degree of synkinesis after 13 months. Patient 1 showed the Sunnybrook (SB) composite score 69 [76 (voluntary movement score) - 0 (resting symmetry score) - 7 (synkinesis score)]. In patient 2, the SB composite score was 76 (80 - 0 - 4, respectively). Conclusions: In this trifurcation approach, cervical cutaneous plexus provides a long complex nerve graft, which allows bridging the gap between proximal FN stump and several peripheral branches without great expenditure. In combination with the HFNT and ansa cervicalis transfer, this procedure enables the facial reanimation with low grade of synkinesis.},

Assessing the surgical outcomes of these procedures is imperative when evaluating the effectiveness of these interventions, especially when establishing a new center focused on the treatment of patients with facial paralysis. We desired to discuss the factors to consider when implementing a facial nerve center and the means by which the specialist can assess and analyze outcomes. Methods: Patients with facial palsy secondary to multiple etiologies, including cerebellopontine angle tumors, head and neck carcinoma, and trauma, who underwent NT or FGMT between 2014 and 2019 were included. Primary outcomes were facial symmetry and smile excursion, calculated using FACE-gram and Emotrics software. Subjective quality of life outcomes, including the Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE) Scale and Synkinesis Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ), were also assessed. Results: 14/22 NT and 6/6 FGMT patients met inclusion criteria having both pre-and postoperative photo documentation. NT increased oral commissure excursion from 0.4 mm (SD 5.3) to 2.9 mm (SD 6.8) (P = 0.05), and improved symmetry of excursion (P {\textless} 0.001) and angle (P {\textless} 0.001). FGMT increased oral commissure excursion from -1.4 mm (SD 3.9) to 2.1 mm (SD 3.7), (P = 0.02), and improved symmetry of excursion (P {\textless} 0.001). FaCE scores improved in NT patients postoperatively (P {\textless} 0.001). Conclusions: Measuring outcomes, critical analyses, and a multidisciplinary approach are necessary components when building a facial nerve center.

	abstract = {The most accepted method for reanimation of the paralyzed face is the two-stage method that combines cross-face nerve graft with free-muscle transfer. Although the results of reconstruction with this method are satisfactory, there is an excessive delay between stages, which prolongs the period of rehabilitation. In 1995, Kumar overcame this and presented his preliminary results from a single-stage transfer of the gracilis. We compared the long-term results of the single-stage with the two-stage method of reconstruction. Patients selected the method of reconstruction on the basis of the information, photographs of scars, and video recording of results given to them at a special facial palsy clinic. Ten patients selected the single-stage reconstruction and 15 selected the two-stage reconstruction. The mean follow-up period was 3 years. The results of the two methods are comparable, with 90 percent of the patients who underwent the single-stage and 93 percent of those who underwent the two-stage procedures having good and fair results. However, the two-stage method scored good symmetry at rest in 67 percent, compared with 20 percent for the single-stage method. There were fewer complications with the single-stage method, and none of the patients had any problems relating to the donor site. The period of rehabilitation was reduced by 10 months with the single-stage method.},

	abstract = {Donor-site morbidity in serratus anterior free-tissue transfers is investigated in 34 consecutive cases. Nineteen lower-extremity reconstructions and 15 facial reconstructions were retrospectively analyzed. office and hospital charts were reviewed, and patients were given a follow-up questionnaire. The mean operative time was 6.3 hr and the mean estimated blood loss was 441 cc. Transfusion was required in 24 percent of cases. The early complication rate was 21 percent consisting of 6 percent hematomas and 15 percent seromas. Scar appearance, pain, numbness, and shoulder strength and mobility were acceptable. Scapular winging was detectable in 3/9 patients examined, but symptomatic in only one. The number of muscle slips harvested or whether the graft was innervated did not significantly affect this rate. Half of the patients had returned to work or school. None attributed any work disability to their donor sites. They participated in many athletic activities, including those requiring upper extremity strength and dexterity. Previously reported series are discussed, and the morbidity of this donor site is compared with reported series of other free muscle flaps. The authors find this flap useful for facial reanimation and for soft-tissue coverage with minimal bulk. Low rates of operative, perioperative, and long-term morbidity are definite advantages.},

	abstract = {Importance: Facial muscle weakness from paralysis or muscle dystrophy can significantly affect lip strength and function. Lip muscle weakness may result in articulation difficulties and spillage of food, both of which are socially and functionally disruptive for patients. There are few quantitative data on the effect of facial paralysis on lip strength. Objectives: To quantify the effect of facial paralysis and muscular dystrophy on lip strength and evaluate the effectiveness of targeted lip injection augmentation. Design, setting, and participants: Analysis of patients at the Johns Hopkins Hospital between January 1, 2008, and July 31, 2014, presenting for treatment of lip incompetence due to facial paralysis and facial muscular dystrophy was prospectively undertaken. Patients who had undergone direct surgical lip procedures were excluded. Main outcomes and measures: Lip pressure measurements, anterior bolus spillage, and articulation of bilabial sounds before and after treatment were assessed by a single speech pathologist. Lip pressures were measured with the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument. Results: Twenty-two patients with unilateral facial paralysis were evaluated for this study. Three patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy were also evaluated. In unilateral facial paralysis, central lip strength was reduced in all patients compared with sex-corrected normative data (mean [SD] central lip strength, 5.5 [2.5] kPa in females and 9.6 [4.6] kPa in males). Compared with the nonparalyzed side, labial strength on the paralyzed sided was reduced by 69\%. After injection augmentation of the paralyzed side, labial strength improved across the entire lip. Mean lip strength improved by 0.7-fold in the central lip from 5.60 to 9.30 kPa (P = .009), by 1.4-fold on the paralyzed side from 2.2 to 5.33 kPa (P = .006), and by 0.4-fold on the unaffected side from 7.11 to 9.56 kPa (P = .12). Lip strength in the 3 patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy were uniformly reduced across the entire lip and improved by 6- to 7-fold after injection augmentation. All patients were noted by the speech pathologist to have improved articulation of plosive sounds and decreased anterior bolus spillage after the injection. Conclusions and relevance: Labial strength is reduced across the lip in patients with unilateral facial paralysis. The Iowa Oral Performance Instrument is an effective tool for measuring labial strength and can be use to evaluate the effectiveness of facial reanimation procedures. Injection augmentation of the lip is a simple and effective means of improving labial strength, bilabial sounds, and anterior spillage in patients with facial paralysis or facial muscular dystrophy.

	title = {Surface electromyographic mapping of the orbicularis oculi muscle for real-time blink detection},
	abstract = {Importance: Facial paralysis is a life-altering condition that significantly impairs function, appearance, and communication. Facial rehabilitation via closed-loop pacing represents a potential but as yet theoretical approach to reanimation. A first critical step toward closed-loop facial pacing in cases of unilateral paralysis is the detection of healthy movements to use as a trigger to prosthetically elicit automatic artificial movements on the contralateral side of the face. Objectives: To test and to maximize the performance of an electromyography (EMG)-based blink detection system for applications in closed-loop facial pacing. Design, setting, and participants: Blinking was detected across the periocular region by means of multichannel surface EMG at an academic neuroengineering and medical robotics laboratory among 15 healthy volunteers. Main outcomes and measures: Real-time blink detection was accomplished by mapping the surface of the orbicularis oculi muscle on one side of the face with a multichannel surface EMG. The biosignal from each channel was independently processed; custom software registered a blink when an amplitude-based or slope-based suprathreshold activity was detected. The experiments were performed when participants were relaxed and during the production of particular orofacial movements. An F1 score metric was used to analyze software performance in detecting blinks. Results: The maximal software performance was achieved when a blink was recorded from the superomedial orbit quadrant. At this recording location, the median F1 scores were 0.89 during spontaneous blinking, 0.82 when chewing gum, 0.80 when raising the eyebrows, and 0.70 when smiling. The overall performance of blink detection was significantly better at the superomedial quadrant (F1 score, 0.75) than at the traditionally used inferolateral quadrant (F1 score, 0.40) (P {\textless} .05). Conclusions and relevance: Electromyographic recording represents an accurate tool to detect spontaneous blinks as part of closed-loop facial pacing systems. The early detection of blink activity may allow real-time pacing via rapid triggering of contralateral muscles. Moreover, an EMG detection system can be integrated in external devices and in implanted neuroprostheses. A potential downside to this approach involves cross talk from adjacent muscles, which can be notably reduced by recording from the superomedial quadrant of the orbicularis oculi muscle and by applying proper signal processing.

	abstract = {Background: Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) is a synthetic porous material that has been used for static suspension in facial paralysis. It is manufactured in thin (1-mm or 2-mm) sheets that can be cut into strips and implanted through keyhole facial incisions. Regional deformities are addressed by multiple suspensions that provide cosmetic and functional therapy. The use of ePTFE eliminates donor site morbidity associated with the traditional harvest of fascia from either the temporal area or fascia lata. However, properties unique to this alloplast contribute to the complications that have occurred after its use in facial reanimation. Objective: To describe complications with the use of ePTFE for facial suspension. Setting: Academic medical center. Method: Retrospective chart review and review of literature. Results: Six patients with facial paralysis who were treated with the ePTFE sling procedure had complications. Five slings failed because of stretch despite prestretching at implantation. One patient developed a late wound infection requiring removal of the sling. Conclusion: An ePTFE facial sling is an option for static facial suspension that can be therapeutic for patients with seventh nerve damage. There is a high rate of complications leading to revision surgery. Future studies are needed to evaluate alloplastic alternatives to ePTFE.},

	abstract = {Objective: One-stage free-flap facial reanimation may be accomplished by using a gracilis transfer innervated by the masseteric nerve, but this technique does not restore the patient's ability to smile spontaneously. By contrast, the transfer of the latissimus dorsi innervated by the contralateral facial nerve provides the correct nerve stimulus but is limited by variation in the quantity of contraction. The authors propose a new one-stage facial reanimation technique using dual innervation; a gracilis muscle flap is innervated by the masseteric nerve, and supplementary nerve input is provided by a cross-face sural nerve graft anastomosed to the contralateral facial nerve branch. Methods: Between October 2009 and March 2010, four patients affected by long-standing unilateral facial paralysis received gracilis muscle transfers innervated by both the masseteric nerve and the contralateral facial nerve. Results: All patients recovered voluntary and spontaneous smiling abilities. The recovery time to voluntary flap contraction was 3.8 months, and spontaneous flap contraction was achieved within 7.2 months after surgery. According to Terzis and Noah's five-stage classification of reanimation outcomes, two patients had excellent outcomes and two had good outcomes. Conclusions: In this preliminary study, the devised double-innervation technique allows to achieve a good grade of flap contraction as well as emotional smiling ability. A wider number of operated patients are needed to confirm those initial findings.},

The ages of the patients ranged from 5 to 63 years (mean: 44.1 years), and 8 (80\%) of the patients were females. The duration of paralysis was no longer than 18 months (mean: 9.7 months). Follow-up varied from 6 to 18 months (mean: 12.6 months). Initial voluntary facial movements were observed between 3 and 6 months postoperatively (mean: 4.3 months). All patients were able to produce the appearance of a smile when asked to clench their teeth. Comparing the definition of the nasolabial fold and the degree of movement of the modiolus on both sides of the face, the voluntary smile was considered symmetrical in 8 cases. Recovery of the capacity to blink spontaneously was not observed. However, 8 patients were able to reduce or suspend the application of artificial tears. The authors suggest consideration of masseteric-facial nerve coaptation, whether temporary (baby-sitter) or permanent, as the principal alternative for reconstruction of facial paralysis due to irreversible nerve lesion with less than 18 months of duration.},

Methods: This thesis included a prospective study to be carried out on 15 patients with unilateral complete lower motor neuron facial paralysis (11 patients after cerebellopontine angle tumour resection and 4 patients after traumatic transverse petrous bone fracture) operated upon by end to end hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis in Cairo university hospitals in the period between June 2015 and January 2017. Results: At one year follow up the improvement of facial nerve functions were as follows: Three cases (20\%) had improved to House Hrackmann grade II, eleven cases (73.33\%) had improved to grade III, and one patient (6.66\%) had improved to House Brackmann grade IV. Conclusion: Despite the various techniques in facial reanimation following facial nerve paralysis, the end to end hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis remains the gold standard procedure with satisfying results in cases of the viable distal facial stump and non-atrophic muscles. Early hypoglossal-facial anastomotic repair after acute facial nerve injury is associated with better long-term facial function outcomes and should be considered in the management algorithm.},

The roles of some variable factors in the outcome of neurorrhaphy with interpositional graft were also evaluated and compared.

	title = {Bidirectional/double fascia grafting for simple and semi-dynamic reconstruction of lower lip deformity in facial paralysis},
	abstract = {Background: For the total aesthetic reconstruction of facial paralysis, treatment of lower lip deformity as "a neglected target in facial reanimation" is important. Although various dynamic reconstruction approaches have been reported for lower lip deformity, these have not been popularly performed due to aggressive surgical invasiveness, long recovery time for reinnervation, and unstable outcomes. To reconstruct the lower lip deformity more simply but semi-dynamically, we modified bidirectional/double fascia grafting methods that have been established as simple and minimally invasive treatments for pediatric congenital lower lip paralysis. Methods: Between 2009 and 2011, nine patients were treated using this procedure alone or with combinations of other procedures of facial reanimation such as one-stage free muscle transfer. For outcome assessment, patients were evaluated using a lower lip paralysis grading system, including the objective aesthetics and functional results of the lower lip at rest (score range, 0-1), during smiling (score range, 0-4), and during mouth opening (score range, 0-2). Results: The mean total scores improved from 1.43 (poor) preoperatively to 5.71 (excellent) postoperatively. In all evaluation items, the postoperative scores improved significantly compared to the preoperative scores (p{\textless}0.01) with no severe complications. Conclusions: The procedure is simply applied to various types of extensive facial paralysis, as well as congenital lower lip paralysis in combination with other static and dynamic reconstruction methods for facial paralysis, and it is suggested that this approach significantly and semi-dynamically improves the aesthetic function of the lower lip at rest, during smiling, and during mouth opening.},

	title = {Multivector functioning muscle transfer using superficial subslips of the serratus anterior muscle for longstanding facial paralysis},
	abstract = {Various donor muscles have been identified for restoring facial function due to longstanding facial paralysis. Donor muscles such as the gracilis and latissimus dorsi are frequently used and often produce one or two reliable vectors of force. However, there are drawbacks of using these muscles, including the instability of separating multivector functioning muscle units and limited amount of muscle contraction. Serratus anterior muscle transfer has the advantages of multiple independently functioning motor units that can be created with a single neurovascular pedicle. This article describes multivector muscle transfer using two or three superficial subslips of the serratus anterior muscle on a single neurovascular pedicle to produce an esthetic smile that is customized to imitate the function of the contralateral mimetic muscles. Twelve patients who had longstanding unilateral facial paralysis underwent muscle transfer consisting of multivector superficial subslips of the serratus anterior muscle innervated by the ipsilateral masseteric nerve. The procedure had an uneventful postoperative course, and patients obtained excellent results, with sufficient upper lip excursion, mouth angle, and lower lip working simultaneously. Functioning muscle transfer using multivector superficial subslips of the serratus anterior muscle is effective for treating longstanding facial paralysis. This technique avoids postoperative bulkiness of the cheek muscle and achieves a more natural and symmetrical smile.},

Method: A retrospective review of intrinsic facial nerve tumours over the last 15 years was performed. Parameters measured included age, presenting symptoms, pre- and post-treatment hearing and House-Brackmann grading, tumour position, treatment and duration of follow up. Results: A total of 15 patients presented with intrinsic facial nerve tumours over the study period. The most common presenting complaint was facial symptoms (93.3 per cent), followed by hearing loss (46.7 per cent). Three patients with stable facial nerve function (House-Brackmann grades II-III) were treated conservatively. Twelve patients underwent surgery to treat progressive or recurrent symptoms. Facial function was maintained or improved in 60.0 per cent of patients and hearing was preserved in 66.7 per cent. Conclusion: We propose that all stable tumours associated with good facial function of grade III or below should be treated conservatively. For symptomatic or progressive lesions, tailored surgery depending on the tumour site and hearing level should be offered to preserve native nerve function and facial musculature. For patients with prolonged paralysis, tumours can be monitored and other forms of facial reanimation and support offered.},

Output potentials from the Hall sensor were monitored during eye blinks and saccadic eye movements to correlate sensor potentials with eye movements. Results indicate that the Hall sensor is effective at determining palpebral closure and discriminating eye closure from other eye movements. Therefore, we conclude that the Hall sensor is a reliable means for determining palpebral closure and is ideally suited for use in a facial prosthesis that uses the normal blink as a trigger to reanimate the contralateral paralyzed eyelid.},

Patients: Four patients with complete facial nerve paralysis due to lesions of the facial nucleus in the pons caused by hemorrhage due to arteriovenous or cavernous venous malformations, stroke, or injury after tumor resection. Intervention: All patients underwent end-to-end hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis. Main outcome measures: Facial nerve function using the House-Brackmann (HB) scale and physical and social/well-being function using the facial disability index. Results: The mean age of the patients was 53.3 years (range, 32-73). There were 3 female and 1 male patients. All patients had preoperative facial function HB VI/VI. With a minimum of 12 months' follow-up after end-to-end hypoglossal-facial anastomosis, 75\% of patients regained function to HB grade III/VI, and 25\% had HB grade IV/VI. Average facial disability index scores were 61.25 for physical function and 78 for social/well-being, comparable to results from complete hypoglossal-facial anastomosis after peripheral facial nerve palsy after acoustic neuroma resection. Conclusion: Patients with nuclear facial paralysis who undergo end-to-end hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis achieve similar degrees of reanimation compared with those with peripheral facial nerve palsies.

Materials and methods: The present study enrolled a total of 10 patients who underwent end-to-side hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis after facial nerve paralysis due to skull base surgery. The data of the patients were gathered from hospital records, pictures, and movies during the 18 months of follow-up. Results: At the 18 months of follow-up, seven (70\%) and three (30\%) patients were reported with grades III and IV of the House-Brackmann scoring system, respectively. In total, out of the seven grade III patients, six subjects underwent early anastomosis (within the first year of the paralysis). On the other hand, among patients with grade IV, two subjects had late anastomosis. Conclusion: It seems that early end-to-side hypoglossal-facial anastomosis can be a favorable surgical option with good facial function results for reanimating the facial function of patients with facial paralysis following skull base surgery.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to describe the survival and volume of microneurovascular muscle flaps at different times after two-stage facial reanimation procedure by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to compare the functional outcome with MRI findings. Fifteen patients with a mean age of 36 years (range 7-63 years) operated on between 1988 and 1999 were available for this study. The muscles used for functional reconstruction were the latissimus dorsi (eight patients), gracilis (six patients) and serratus anterior (one patient). Hospital charts were reviewed and the clinical outcome of facial reanimation was graded on a scale from 1 to 6 according to House. The mean postoperative follow-up time was 7 years (range 3-14 years). Clinical grading and 1.5 T unit MRI of patients were performed concomitantly. The MR images were evaluated semi-quantitatively so that the muscle structure of the free flaps was graded on a scale from 1 to 4. The free flap area of each slice was defined and the volume of the free flap was calculated. Data were analysed statistically. The long-term functional outcome of the facial reanimation was regarded as good in 10 patients, which means they had only mild or moderate dysfunction of facial movements. In MR images, six free flaps displayed normal muscle structure, another six had a fatty appearance and two displayed severe muscle atrophy; in one patient the muscle tissue could not be identified. The volume of the free flap clearly declined in the course of the follow-up. A correlation was found between good functional outcome and normal muscle structure of the free flap in MRI, p = 0.020. The longer the follow-up time after muscle transplantation the poorer the functional result. A similar correlation was found between abnormal muscle structure in MRI and a long follow-up time. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to assess the muscle structure of free microneurovascular flaps. Normal findings in MRI seem to correlate with a good clinical outcome in facial reanimation. A good functional result correlates with a shorter follow-up time and normal muscle structure in MRI.},

	abstract = {An anatomic study was performed on living subjects using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to distinguish the relative contribution of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle to dynamic changes in the nasolabial fold during facial animation and aging. MRI scans with the face in repose and then holding a full smile were performed in both young and old adult subjects. Anatomic landmarks were identified, and measurements characterizing their position were made on the MRI console. MRI resulted in excellent image resolution of facial tissue planes. Comparison between young and old subjects with the face in repose demonstrated that progressive thickening of the dependent portion of the check fat pad and overlying skin, with no appreciable change in the muscle plane comprising the levators of the upper lip, resulted in a deeper and more acute nasolabial fold in older subjects. In both age groups there was significant shortening of the mimetic muscles with smiling, with the lateral mimetic muscles drawn closer to the underlying facial bones. This was accompanied by redistribution of the cheek fat pad, thereby maintaining projection of surface landmarks within the cheek mass in young subjects with smiling. These findings indicate that in order to diminish the nasolabial fold, surgery for facial rejuvenation should be directed to the skin and subcutaneous tissue planes superficial to the mimetic muscles to the upper lip. In order to recreate a natural nasolabial fold during surgery for facial reanimation, contraction of the levator muscles to the upper lip should result in redistribution of the cheek fat pad without change in surface projection of the cheek mass or upper lip; this can only be accomplished if the reconstructed levator muscle is positioned deep to the cheek fat pad, with its insertion toward the deep (mucosal) surface of the upper lip.},

	title = {Assessment of {T}-shape double fascia graft for lower lip deformity from facial paralysis: {A} questionnaire survey},
	abstract = {Introduction: There are two main methods to treat lower-lip deformity (LLD) in facial paralysis. The first method is surgical intervention on the side of the paralysis, and the second involves denervating the depressor muscles on the healthy side. It is sometimes difficult for patients to ethically accept the denervating healthy tissue; therefore, we performed the T-shape double fascia graft (TSDFG), which reportedly restores symmetry. In this study, we report our experience with TSDFG and evaluation of the outcomes including the patient questionnaires. Methods: Two fascia strips from the thigh, 7 ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö‚â• 70 mm in size, were used; one was grafted horizontally at the lower lip to correct the static position, and the other was grafted obliquely at the lateral side by folding and crossing the horizontal fascia. A total of nine patients were treated by this procedure; three procedures were performed individually and six were performed in combination with another static or reanimation procedure. A questionnaire containing a five-point scoring system for facial appearance in multiple situations and other problems was sent to each patient at least 6 months after the surgery. Result: From the physicians' point of view, all patients achieved an improvement in symmetry of the lower lip, particularly when opening of the mouth; however, assessments from the patients demonstrated much less satisfaction. The main reason for the dissatisfaction was the slight bulkiness of the red lip. There was one comment that noted that with more treatment, the expectations were higher, and, as a result, the patient could not admit satisfaction at the end. Discussion: TSDFG is a simple and effective procedure for LLD; however, slight modifications may be required. In addition, there were some gaps in the perception of the results between the physicians and patients, and we need to consider these when planning to treat LLD.},

	abstract = {Dynamic facial reanimation with free muscle or nerve transfers represents the mainstay of facial paralysis treatments particularly for perioral area and smile. These techniques are not always feasible, in such cases we perform a perioral suspension with fascia lata graft. However many teams blame this technique for short-term recurrence of the deformity. We describe in this paper details of our surgical technique, to improve the aesthetic result and stability over time, and the results and complications encountered. Fascia lata graft was sutured beyond the midline to the contralateral healthy lips, after tunneling through upper and lower orbicularis oris. Fascia lata graft was then tunneled through the buccal fat pad, then under the zygomatic arch to the temporal region, where the temporal aponeurosis was incised to make way for the fascia lata graft, which was fixed to the outer face of the temporal aponeurosis, applying slight overcorrection to the oral commissure. From 2003 to 2012, we performed this procedure on 8 patients. Results showed an immediate aesthetic improvement, stable over time. Perioral suspension with fascia lata graft is a surgical alternative when dynamic reanimation is not feasible.},

	abstract = {Background: Facial nerve (FN) outcome has been improved by deciding upon the degree of vestibular schwannoma (VS) resection guided by intraoperative facial nerve monitoring (IOFM). This study aimed to evaluate hearing and FN outcomes following IOFM-guided VS removal through a retrosigmoid approach (RS). Methods: Between January 2015 and August 2017, 77 patients undergoing VS resection through RS, regardless of their preoperative hearing or tumor size, were included in this monocentric retrospective study. Total or near-/subtotal resection was decided intraoperatively according to IOFM. Partial resection was planned preoperatively. Pre- and postoperative FN function (House-Brackmann) and hearing level (AAO-HNS and Gardner-Robertson (GR) scales) were reported. Predictive factors for hearing preservation were analyzed according to a score developed to take into account pre-/postoperative hearing evolution. Results: The mean extrameatal diameter was 17 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 8.5 mm. VS resection was total, near-/subtotal, and partial in 71\%, 21\%, and 8\% of cases, respectively. Postoperative grade I and II FN function was achieved in 91\% of patients. Serviceable (A+B or GR I+II) hearing and hearing with intelligibility (A+B+C or GR I-III) were preserved in 30\% and 43\% of cases, respectively. In multivariate analysis, preoperative synchronized auditory brainstem responses (ABR) were the only predictive factor (p = 0.006) imparting a five times greater chance of hearing preservation. Conclusion: IOFM-guided VS excision through RS, whatever the VS size and hearing level, achieved a high rate of good postoperative FN function together with significant hearing preservation, and it should be used if hearing with some intelligibility is still present preoperatively, even in large VS.},

	title = {Localization of the cortical response to smiling using new imaging paradigms with functional magnetic resonance imaging},
	abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can serve to localize activity in the cerebral cortex. The present study was performed to develop a quantitative means of describing the cortical location activated during voluntary smiling in multiple subjects and to determine whether this location is specific to smiling when compared with other motor tasks. Five human subjects were instructed to smile or to tap the fingers of both hands. Both tasks were performed in a blocked-trial paradigm that consisted of alternating 15-second blocks of a repetitive motor task and 15 seconds of rest. Smiling was also performed as an event-related paradigm in which the subject smiled briefly once every 15 seconds for 20 repetitions that were combined to produce an average response to a single smile. A series of 300 images was acquired using an echo-planar imaging sequence (24-cm field of view; 5-mm slice thickness; repetition time/echo time, 1000/27.2 msec). Each subject's three-dimensional brain images were transformed to Talairach coordinates by stretching or compressing the brain images to fit the standard brain as defined in the Talairach atlas. This allowed data from five subjects to be combined for a numeric description. Functional activation maps acquired by use of the event-related paradigm contained significantly fewer motion artifacts than maps acquired with the blocked-trial paradigm, allowing better visualization of functionally active areas. Three-dimensional Talairach coordinates to describe the locations of peak cortical activity after smiling and finger tapping were established. These coordinates were consistent among subjects. During smiling, statistically significant activation was seen in the motor cortex, primarily along the precentral sulcus; this was inferior and anterior to the region that was associated with finger tapping. This study demonstrates that motion artifacts associated with traditional blocked-trial fMRI protocols can be overcome by employing an event-related paradigm to obtain an average response from a single smile. With the implementation of new imaging paradigms with fMRI, an area of the cerebral cortex has been identified that is specifically activated during voluntary smiling, and remains consistent among subjects. Quantification of fMRI data represents a powerful tool by which to study the cortical response to motor activity and to monitor possible alteration in this activity after injury or surgery. When combined with biofeedback therapy, this technique may help to improve the outcome of facial reanimation procedures in the future.},

	abstract = {Importance: Most rehabilitation specialists and many facial reanimation surgeons use the Sunnybrook Facial Grading System (FGS) to measure and detect changes in facial function. The eFACE, an electronic and digitally graded facial measurement scale, was recently created to provide similar information to the Sunnybrook FGS, but with scaling uniformity across all categories of facial function, graphical outputs, and easy-to-use visual analog scales. Objectives: To establish the correlation between the scores on the eFACE and the Sunnybrook FGS among patients with facial paralysis and to compare the reliability of the 2 scales. Design, setting, and participants: A retrospective review of medical records identified 109 patients who were evaluated at a facial nerve center by physical therapists using the eFACE and the Sunnybrook FGS on the same day, between November 1, 2014, and May 31, 2015. The level of facial function predicted using the 2 scales was compared to study correlation between the scales. Data analysis was conducted from June 1 to September 1, 2015. Main outcomes and measures: Correlation between the Sunnybrook FGS and the eFACE grading scale. Methods: Two independent physical therapists evaluated patients using both the eFACE and the Sunnybrook FGS. Scores were compared and the Spearman rank correlation coefficient was calculated between the total scores and each of the 3 subscores, including static, dynamic, and synkinesis scores. The total Sunnybrook FGS synkinesis score (worst score, 15; perfect score, 0) and static score (worst score, 20; perfect score, 0) were normalized to a 100-point scale with the eFACE (perfect score, 100; worst score, 1). Results: eFACE scores ranged from 48 to 100, and Sunnybrook FGS scores ranged from 0 to 100. Among 109 patients, there was a moderately strong correlation between eFACE and Sunnybrook FGS scores in both total and subcategory scores. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient of the total eFACE and Sunnybrook FGS was 0.75 (r {\textless} 0.0001). For the static scores, the correlation coefficient was -0.71 (r {\textless} 0.0001). The correlation coefficients for the dynamic and synkinesis scores were 0.77 (r {\textless} 0.0001) and -0.78 (r {\textless} 0.0001), respectively. Conclusions and relevance: There is moderately good agreement between the Sunnybrook FGS and the eFACE. Given the ease of using the eFACE on mobile devices, as well as its additional functionality, it may represent a reasonable facial grading option across disciplines in the future. Level of evidence: NA.},

	title = {One-stage dual latissimus dorsi muscle flap transfer with a pair of vascular anastomoses and double nerve suturing for long-standing facial paralysis},
	abstract = {Objective: Various types of neurovascular free-muscle transfers have been reported as surgical treatments for long-standing facial paralysis. Among one-stage methods, two approaches, that is, latissimus dorsi transfer with nerve suturing to the contralateral facial nerve and gracilis transfer with nerve suturing to the ipsilateral masseteric nerve, have recently become popular. The former method has the advantage of making spontaneous smiling possible, but the contraction strength of the transferred muscle varies, whereas the latter approach has the advantage of guaranteeing voluntary contraction of the transferred muscle, but makes spontaneous smiling difficult. Recently, dual innervation methods have also been reported, but uncertainty remains about the utility of such approaches. To overcome these drawbacks, we devised a hybrid method combining the two previously established techniques. Methods: Two latissimus dorsi muscle flaps containing the thoracodorsal vessels from one side are transferred with a pair of vascular anastomoses. The true trunk of the thoracodorsal nerve, which innervates one of the muscle flaps, is sutured to the contralateral facial nerve, while the short branch of the thoracodorsal nerve, which innervates the other muscle flap, is sutured to the ipsilateral masseteric nerve. From November 2011 to October 2013, we used this method in four patients with long-standing facial paralysis. Results: Smiling was assessed in the three patients who were followed up for more than 1 year, and satisfactory results were obtained (Harii score: 4-5). In one patient, the movement mediated via the contralateral facial nerve was a little weak, but this was compensated for by the muscles controlled by the ipsilateral masseteric nerve. Conclusion: Our novel one-stage method, which involves a combination of two previously established methods, guarantees early voluntary smiling, and spontaneous smiling becomes possible later. In addition, it is free from the uncertainty associated with double innervation and does not require nerve grafts. So, stable results can be expected in most patients with long-standing facial paralysis.},

Graduated minimally invasive facial reanimation is based on a modular principle.

Applying a concept of a graduated minimally invasive facial reanimation may help minimize surgical trauma and reduce morbidity. Twenty patients underwent a graduated minimally invasive facial reanimation. A retrospective chart review was performed with a follow-up examination between 1 and 8 months after surgery. The FACEgram software was used to calculate pre- and postoperative eyelid closure, the level of brows, nasal, and philtral symmetry as well as oral commissure position at rest and oral commissure excursion with smile. As a patient-oriented outcome parameter, the Glasgow Benefit Inventory questionnaire was applied. There was a statistically significant improvement in the postoperative score of eyelid closure, brow asymmetry, nasal asymmetry, philtral asymmetry as well as oral commissure symmetry at rest (p {\textless} 0.05). Smile evaluation revealed no significant change of oral commissure excursion. The mean Glasgow Benefit Inventory score indicated substantial improvement in patients' overall quality of life. If a primary facial nerve repair or microneurovascular tissue transfer cannot be applied, graduated minimally invasive facial reanimation is a promising option to restore facial function and symmetry at rest.},

	abstract = {Objective: To discuss the causes, sites, management strategies and curative effects of accidental facial nerve paralysis in the middle ear surgery. Methods: Forty two cases with peripheral facial nerve paralysis following middle ear surgery who underwent surgical exploration and reanimation were analyzed. Facial nerve decompression, primary end-to-end anastomosis, interpositional nerve grafts with the great auricular nerve and nerve substitution of facial-hypoglossal anastomosis were applied to restoration of the facial nerve function. The facial nerve function was graded according to House-Brackmann (HB) Grade. Results: The most common operation complicating iatrogenic facial nerve injury was mastoidectomy, and the common sites of the injured facial nerve were the tympanic segment and pyramid segment. The facial nerve exploration showed facial nerve edema in nine cases (21.4\%), injury of the facial nerve sheath was observed in 10 cases (23.8\%), partial nerve fibers transection was found in four cases (9.5\%), total nerve fibers transection was detected in 17 cases (40.5\%) and two cases (4.8\%) with facial nerve anatomical integrity. Facial nerve re-animation methods include facial nerve decompression in 24 cases (57.1\%), end-to-end anastomosis in two cases (4.8\%), end-to-end anastomosis after nerve transfer in two cases (4.8\%), interpositional nerve grafts with the great auricular nerve in 10 cases (23.8\%) and facial-hypoglossal nerve anastomosis in four cases (9.5\%). The facial nerve function was graded according to House-Brackmann Grade before and after surgery. Twenty eight patients were followed up more than one year. For the 17 cases who received facial nerve decompression, four cases recovered to House-Brackmann Grade I, 11 cases recovered to House-Brackmann Grade II, two cases recovered to House-Brackmann Grade III. For the five cases who underwent the great auricular nerve grafting, three cases recovered to House-Brackmann Grade II, two cases recovered to House-Brackmann Grade III. For the four cases who received facial-hypoglossal nerve anastomosis recovered to House-Brackmann Grade III. For the two cases who underwent the end-to-end anastomosis recovered to House-Brackmann Grade II. Conclusions: The tympanic segment and pyramid segment are more vulnerable to be injured during mastoid surgery. The injured facial nerve should be explored and repaired.

	title = {End-to-side "loop" graft for total facial nerve reconstruction: {Over} 10 years experience},
	abstract = {Background: Multiple-branch reconstruction is required in order to attain facial reanimation for extensive facial nerve defects. We previously reported that end-to-side nerve grafting, with the use of a single nerve graft for defect reconstruction, was easy to perform. We have also demonstrated the efficacy of end-to-side nerve suture of the recipient nerve to the donor graft nerve, in experimental rat models and clinical cases. The regenerating axons, which extended into the nerve graft, were "distributed" to multiple recipient nerves via end-to-side nerve-suture sites. Methods: Thirty-two patients who underwent facial nerve reconstruction (five to 10 branches) had a single sural nerve graft coapted to the proximal stump of the facial nerve in an end-to-end manner, followed by end-to-side nerve suture of the recipient nerve stumps to the side of the nerve graft. In 19 patients who were expected to undergo postoperative radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, the distal end of the graft was connected to the side of the hypoglossal nerve for "axonal supercharging," to enhance the recovery of the facial muscles. Results: Initial facial movements were noted at 5-12 months postoperatively, and good recovery (House-Brackmann grade III/IV) was observed during long-term follow-up in most patients. Conclusion: End-to-side nerve suture of the recipient nerve stumps to the nerve graft requires less graft nerve material and less technical mastery to reconstruct multiple branches of the facial nerve. We also described the concept of "axonal supercharging," namely the connection of double-donor neural sources to the graft, and "axonal distribution," namely the reinnervation of multiple recipient nerve stumps connected to the graft in an end-to-side manner. This combination of axonal supercharging and distribution can be a useful option in facial nerve reconstruction.},

	title = {Blink restoration in adult facial paralysis},
	abstract = {Background: Impaired eyelid function in facial paralysis patients is a serious disability that can even threaten vision. Eye reanimation techniques and specifically blink restoration reinstates the cornea's protective mechanism and recovers a more natural appearance and eye function. Both dynamic and static procedures have been used to augment eye closure, but only dynamic procedures can lead to blink restoration. In this study, the experience of a single surgeon (J.K.T.) with dynamic procedures addressing the challenge of blink restoration is presented. Methods: A retrospective review of 95 adult patients who underwent dynamic procedures for blink restoration was performed. The patients were divided into two groups. Group A (n = 75) included patients who underwent nerve transfers, including cross-facial nerve grafting and subsequent microcoaptations, mini-hypoglossal nerve transfers, and direct orbicularis oculi muscle neurotization. Group B (n = 20) included patients who underwent eye sphincter substitution procedures, including pedicled frontalis or mini-temporalis transfers, free platysma, occipitalis, gracilis subunits, extensor digitorum brevis, and a slip of adductor longus transfer. Objective blink ratios were measured according to a protocol established by the senior author (J.K.T.). Results: The patients included 34 men and 61 women. Mean age was 34.9 +/- 9.8 years. Denervation time ranged from 7 months to 42.12 years, and the mean denervation time was 13.02 years. Blink improvement was noted in all of the patients. Blink scores and ratios were consistently better in group A than in group B. Conclusion: Dynamic procedures provide the functional substrate on which subsequent static procedures can be performed and aid blink return.},

	title = {Changing perception: facial reanimation surgery improves attractiveness and decreases negative facial perception},
	abstract = {Objectives/hypothesis: Determine the effect of facial reanimation surgery on observer-graded attractiveness and negative facial perception of patients with facial paralysis. Study design: Randomized controlled experiment. Methods: Ninety observers viewed images of paralyzed faces, smiling and in repose, before and after reanimation surgery, as well as normal comparison faces. Observers rated the attractiveness of each face and characterized the paralyzed faces by rating severity, disfigured/bothersome, and importance to repair. Iterated factor analysis indicated these highly correlated variables measure a common domain, so they were combined to create the disfigured, important to repair, bothersome, severity (DIBS) factor score. Mixed effects linear regression determined the effect of facial reanimation surgery on attractiveness and DIBS score. Results: Facial paralysis induces an attractiveness penalty of 2.51 on a 10-point scale for faces in repose and 3.38 for smiling faces. Mixed effects linear regression showed that reanimation surgery improved attractiveness for faces both in repose and smiling by 0.84 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67, 1.01) and 1.24 (95\% CI: 1.07, 1.42) respectively. Planned hypothesis tests confirmed statistically significant differences in attractiveness ratings between postoperative and normal faces, indicating attractiveness was not completely normalized. Regression analysis also showed that reanimation surgery decreased DIBS by 0.807 (95\% CI: 0.704, 0.911) for faces in repose and 0.989 (95\% CI: 0.886, 1.093), an entire standard deviation, for smiling faces. Conclusions: Facial reanimation surgery increases attractiveness and decreases negative facial perception of patients with facial paralysis. These data emphasize the need to optimize reanimation surgery to restore not only function, but also symmetry and cosmesis to improve facial perception and patient quality of life.},

	title = {Hemihypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis for facial nerve palsy},
	abstract = {Background and purpose: Commonly used classic hypoglossal (CN XII) to facial nerve (CN VII) anastomosis has the disadvantage of tongue hemiatrophy. Thus, various attempts have been made to modify this method to reduce the tongue damage. The aim of this report was to present the results of hemihypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis (HHFA) technique in relation to facial muscles reanimation and hemitongue atrophy. Material and methods: The first 7 consecutive patients who underwent CN VII anastomosis with half of the CNXII, for which the follow-up period exceeded 12 months, were analysed. During the procedure, CN VII was transected as proximally as possible after drilling the mastoid process. CN XII was separated longitudinally into two parts at a short distance to allow suture of the stumps without any tension. One half of CN XII was transected and sutured to the distal stump of CN VII. Recovery from facial palsy was quantified with the House-Brackmann grading system (HB). Tongue function was assessed according to the scale proposed by Martins. Results: Features of initial reinnervation of facial muscles were visible after 6 months in all 7 patients. All patients achieved satisfactory outcome of CN VII regeneration (HB grade III) until the last control examination (12-27 months after surgery, mean 16). No or minimal tongue atrophy without deviation (grades I-II according to the Martins scale) was found in 4 patients. Mild hemiatrophy with tongue deviation {\textless} 30 degrees (grade III) was visible in 3 patients. Conclusions: In our experience, HHFA is effective treatment of facial palsy and gives a chance to reduce damage of the tongue.},

	abstract = {Eight patients underwent hemihypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis (anastomosis of a split hypoglossal nerve to the facial nerve) for treatment of unilateral facial palsy. All patients previously had undergone resection of a large acoustic neurinoma and the facial nerve had been resected at that time. The interval between tumor resection and hemihypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis ranged from 1 to 6 months, with an average of 2.1 months. Postoperative recovery of facial movement was good in all cases during an average follow-up period of 4.2 years. In all eight patients, the degree of hypoglossal nerve atrophy on the operated side was graded mild or moderate, but not severe. It was concluded that hemihypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis results in good facial reanimation as long as the procedure is performed early after the onset of facial palsy and that this procedure may reduce the degree of hemiglossal atrophy in comparison with classic hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis.},

Methods: A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent free gracilis muscle transfer for smile reanimation after radical parotidectomy between 2003 and 2016 was performed. Patient-reported quality of life (Facial Clinimetric Evaluation Scale [FaCE]), physician-reported facial function ("eFACE" facial grading scale), and oral commissure excursion were compared preoperatively and postoperatively. Results: Twelve patients were identified with prior surgery and adjuvant therapy (radiotherapy in 6 cases and chemoradiotherapy in 6 cases). Significant postoperative improvements were demonstrated for ipsilateral commissure excursion with smile (preoperatively: -2.2 mm [SD 2.3 mm] vs postoperatively: 7.9 mm [SD 2.5 mm]; P = .002), with meaningful smile achieved in 11 of 12 cases (91.7\%).

	abstract = {Background: Masseter-to-facial nerve transfer is a new procedure for patients who acquire a proximal injury to the facial nerve. This article reports that this procedure is effective and associated with minimal morbidities. Methods: From November 2010 to February 2013, 16 patients underwent a masseter-to-facial nerve transfer. Their denervation periods varied from 2 to 18 months, with an average of 10.1¬¨¬±4.1 months. Their ages varied from 22 to 70 years, with an average of 34.7¬¨¬±15.4 years. The etiology of denervation was tumor resection in the cerebellopontine angle in all cases. All of the patients were followed up several times. The outcomes of the first follow-up at 3 months postoperatively and the last follow-up at a minimum 12 months postoperatively were documented. Using Terzis' and Metha's scales, the smile outcomes and synkinetic movements as visualized using standardized videos were graded preoperatively and postoperatively. The periods between the operation and the onset of mimetic muscle contraction were documented. A questionnaire was administered to evaluate the donor-site morbidity and the ability to smile without biting. Results: The final outcomes for smile function were as follows: 9 patients (56.3\%) had excellent or good function, 5 patients (31.3\%) had moderate function, and 2 patients (12.5\%) had poor function. There was significant improvement between the preoperative and postoperative time points and between the outcomes at the first and last follow-ups (P{\textless}0.05). Additionally, 13 (81.3\%) patients had the ability to smile without biting 12 months postoperatively. The onset of muscle motion varied from 56 to 365 days and was positively correlated with age in the group of patients older than 40 years and negatively correlated with the outcome of the first follow-up. Four (25\%) patients complained of concavity at the parotideomasseteric region, but none complained of disturbance in food intake. Synkinetic movements were observed in all patients and were rated as mild. Conclusions: The masseter-facial nerve transfer effectively reanimated the paralytic muscle in patients who acquired an intracranial facial nerve injury with minimal deficits at the donor site. After continued physical therapy, some patients were able to regain a symmetrical and effortless smile with mild synkinetic movements.},

	title = {A simple reconstruction for congenital unilateral lower lip palsy},
	abstract = {Background: Congenital unilateral lower lip palsy or congenital hypoplasia of the depressor anguli oris muscle, also known as asymmetric crying facies, characterized by deformity of the lower lip, lacks aggressive surgical intervention methods. Although several dynamic and static reconstruction methods have been reported, textbooks introduce only passive surgical intervention, of weakening the unaffected side through techniques such as selective marginal mandibular neurectomy which, however, tends to produce lack of emotive movement. Therefore, a new surgical intervention for the reconstructive treatment of asymmetric crying facies is presented. Methods: A bidirectional (horizontal and vertical) fascia was grafted to restore the aesthetic appearance of the asymmetric lower lip. The horizontal fascial strip achieves restoration of the center of the lower lip to its proper position, whereas the vertical fascial strip achieves aesthetic symmetry of the lower lip at mouth opening. Each end of the vertical strip is anchored to the lower lip and the mandibular bone, respectively, thereby allowing simultaneous movement of the mandible and lower lip. Results: The reconstruction of unilateral lower lip palsy has been successfully performed on seven patients, with ages ranging from 2 years 9 months to 11 years 1 month, since June of 1996. Conclusions: The aim of this procedure is not to achieve complete dynamic reanimation. However, with regard to its simplicity and minimal invasiveness and the satisfaction of the patients, it is considered to be a well-balanced surgical intervention.},

Conclusions: The insertion of an eyelid goldweight in the upper eyelid in patients with established facial palsy is an effective method of reducing the incidence of discomfort to the eye and corneal complications. The insertion is simple and performed under local anaesthesia, and is easily reversed or revised if necessary.},

Objective: The study objective was to compare the morbidity and effectiveness of FFGF reanimation among senior and younger patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective chart review was performed on 20 consecutive patients aged 60 years and above (seniors) and 35 patients aged 40 years and below (juniors) who underwent FFGF for facial reanimation. Among this group, 16 senior and 22 junior patients with available long-term follow-up data were analyzed for functional outcomes. Main Outcomes and Measures: The length of postoperative stay and postoperative complications were compared with assess immediate results. A second analysis for functional outcomes was assessed by resting and smile facial asymmetry index (FAI), as well as maxillary dental display to compare facial tone and lip excursion. Results: The average age of seniors was 67 ¬¨¬± 5 years and that of juniors was 27 ¬¨¬± 10 years. Mean lengths of postoperative stay were 4 ¬¨¬± 2 versus 3 ¬¨¬± 1 days in seniors versus Juniors, respectively (p = 0.16). There were no intraoperative complications and postoperative complications in one (5\%) senior and four (11\%) juniors (p = 0.64). There was functional muscle recovery in all cases, with more pronounced correction of both resting (≈í√Æ3.0 mm vs. ≈í√Æ2.4 mm, p = 0.66) and dynamic (≈í√Æ5.2 mm vs. ≈í√Æ4.2 mm, p = 0.37) FAI in seniors than in juniors. Among patients who underwent a multivector FGFF, there was an additional three versus one visualized maxillary teeth (p = 0.03) in seniors versus juniors, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: The FFGF is effective for facial reanimation among seniors and can be performed with minimal morbidity. Age alone should not preclude the application of the FFGF in seniors with a preference for more dynamic options.},

	abstract = {Background: Despite advanced techniques for reanimation of the lower face, many patients opt for static suspension procedures, which are less invasive and have a relatively short recovery period. However, even static suspension procedures require general anesthesia, overnight hospital stay, and significant soft tissue manipulation. We present a minimally invasive technique, the multivectored suture suspension, which addresses these drawbacks. Objectives: To study the technical feasibility and efficacy of the multivectored suture suspension technique in the paralyzed face. Design: The study was carried out prospectively in 12 patients with House-Brackmann grade 6 facial paralysis. Nine patients presented within 6 months of tumor resection and 3 patients presented more than 1 year after surgery. Main outcome measures: The parameters evaluated were (1). restoration of nasal breathing; (2). improvement of drooling; (3). restoration of normal speech; (4). cosmetic results; and (5). total surgical time. Results: With an average follow-up of 14 months, patient evaluation of the outcome parameters was as follows: (1). 10 patients (83\%) reported significant and 2 (17\%) reported moderate restoration of nasal breathing; (2). 10 patients (83\%) reported significant improvement and 2 (17\%) reported modest drooling improvement; (3). 8 patients (66\%) reported significant improvement and 4 (34\%) reported modest improvement of speech; (4). 9 patients (75\%) reported complete satisfaction and 3 (25\%) reported moderate satisfaction with cosmesis. The average surgical time was 46 minutes. Three revisions were required for suture failure. Conclusions: The multivectored suture suspension technique is a minimally invasive, reversible method of lower facial reanimation that provides improved cosmesis with restoration of nasal breathing. It can be performed under local anesthesia in an outpatient setting, thereby reducing morbidity and cost.},

	abstract = {Background: Ablative orofacial defects incorporating mimetic facial musculature/nerve cause hemifacial expressive dysfunction and considerable morbidity but are rarely reanimated immediately using free functioning gracilis myocutaneous flaps. Methods: Disrupted buccal branches provided a recipient facial nerve for 24 gracilis reinnervations. An additional 15 free flaps were used for extensive composite defects. Smile outcome was graded according to Terzis' criteria after 2 years of recurrence-free follow-up. The effects of postoperative radiotherapy, integrity of the oral commissure, and double free flaps were compared. Results: Eighteen patients completed 2 years' recurrence-free follow-up; average smile outcome was Terzis grade 4 (mean, 3.8). Resection/reconstruction of the modiolus (five of 18 patients) tended to diminish outcome (Terzis grade 3, mean, 3.0; median, 3; versus Terzis grade 4, mean, 4.1; median, 5) compared with two free flaps performed simultaneously(mean, 3.56 versus 4.14; median, 3 versus 5).

	abstract = {Background: Transferring the hypoglossal nerve to the facial nerve using an end-to-end method is very effective for improving facial motor function. However, this technique may result in hemitongue atrophy. The ansa cervicalis, which arises from the cervical plexus, is also used for facial reanimation. We retrospectively reviewed cases where facial reanimation was performed using the ansa cervicalis to overcome the shortcomings of existing techniques of hypoglossal nerve transfer. Methods: The records of 15 patients who underwent hypoglossal nerve transfer were retrospectively reviewed. Three methods were used: facial reanimation with hypoglossal nerve transfer (group 1), facial nerve reanimation using the ansa cervicalis (group 2), and sural nerve interposition grafting between the hypoglossal nerve and facial nerve (group 3). In group 1, the ansa cervicalis was coapted to neurotize the distal stump of the hypoglossal nerve in a subset of patients. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the House-Brackmann (H-B) grading system and Emotrics software. Results: All patients in group 1 (n = 4) achieved H-B grade IV facial function and showed improvements in the oral commissure angle at rest (preoperative vs. postoperative difference, 6.48¬¨‚àû ¬¨¬± 0.77¬¨‚àû) and while smiling (13.88¬¨‚àû ¬¨¬± 2.00¬¨‚àû). In groups 2 and 3, the oral commissure angle slightly improved at rest (group 2: 0.95¬¨‚àû ¬¨¬± 0.53¬¨‚àû, group 3: 1.35¬¨‚àû ¬¨¬± 1.02¬¨‚àû) and while smiling (group 2: 2.06¬¨‚àû ¬¨¬± 0.67¬¨‚àû, group 3: 1.23¬¨‚àû ¬¨¬± 0.56¬¨‚àû). In group 1, reduced tongue morbidity was found in patients who underwent ansa cervicalis transfer. Conclusion: Facial reanimation with hypoglossal nerve transfer, in combination with hypoglossal nerve neurotization using the ansa cervicalis for complete facial palsy patients, might enable favorable facial reanimation outcomes and reduce tongue morbidity. Facial reanimation using the ansa cervicalis or sural nerve for incomplete facial palsy patients did not lead to remarkable improvements, but it warrants further investigation.},

	abstract = {The hemitongue paralysis that occurs as a result of a classic hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover procedure can result in profound functional deficits in speech, mastication, and swallowing. The procedure is not an option in patients with bilateral facial paralysis or those at risk for combined cranial nerve deficits. To address some of the drawbacks and limitations of this classic procedure, we developed the hypoglossal-facial nerve interpositional jump graft (12-7 jump graft) procedure. This procedure involves interposing a nerve graft between a partially severed but functionally intact twelfth cranial nerve and the degenerated seventh cranial nerve, and is often combined with other reanimation procedures. To date, we have performed 33 12-7 jump graft procedures in 30 patients (three were treated for bilateral facial paralysis); this report describes the procedure and its indications, and details the results of 23 procedures performed in 20 patients for whom 24-month follow-up data are available. Twelfth nerve deficits occurred in only three patients in this report. Recovery of facial function began between 3 and 24 months postoperatively. Facial tone and symmetry were achieved in every patient, no patient had significant mass movement, and 13 patients (two of whom were treated for bilateral facial paralysis) had excellent and three had superb restoration of facial movement. These results show the 12-7 jump graft to be a valuable adjunct for facial reanimation in selected patients.},

	abstract = {Reanimation of a spontaneous and synchronous smile, and sufficient depressor mechanism of the lower lip presents a surgical challenge in facial paralysis. Hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover and cross-facial nerve grafting are the best options if the mimetic muscles around the mouth are still viable in patients in whom the facial nerve was sacrificed at the brainstem. Although good muscle tone and facial motion have been obtained by hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover, smile is dependent on conscious tongue movement. Cross-facial nerve grafting provides a voluntary and emotion-driven smile, but requires two coaptation sites, which leads to substantial axonal loss and a long regeneration time. This method was not successful in activating the depressor mechanism. The first stage is the classic "baby-sitting" procedure, in which the bulk of the mimetic muscles was maintained by the rapid reinnervation of the hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover during the regeneration period of the cross-facial nerve graft, and temporalis muscle transfer to the eyelids is performed. During the second stage, the cross-facial nerve graft that used the thickest zygomaticobuccal branch on the healthy side was coapted with the corresponding branches on the paralyzed side. The hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover continued to innervate the depressor muscles. Good spontaneous smile and sufficient depressor mechanism were achieved by cross-facial nerve grafting and hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover respectively, and these techniques are demonstrated by the authors clinically and electrophysiologically.},

Relative to preoperative excursion, there was significant increase of 3.33 mm in commissure excursion seen at the 0 to 3 month period for LTM patients (P = 0.04). Commisure excursion for CFNG-FGMT was seen later, in the 3- to 6-month postoperative period (4.01, P = 0.024). During smile, CFNG-FGMT patients had better symmetry than unilateral LTM patients. In bilateral LTM patients, there was no significant change in symmetry. Conclusion: Dynamic facial animation improved in both surgical groups. The LTM demonstrates a faster rate of muscle recruitment compared to CFNG-FGMT. After 3 months, both LTM and CFNG-FGMT groups had comparable excursions. A decision-making algorithm is presented.},

	title = {Botulinum toxin injection in long-standing facial paralysis patients: improvement of facial symmetry observed up to 6 months},
	abstract = {Background: Despite modern reanimation surgical techniques, facial paralysis presents with functional and aesthetic deficits. We evaluated facial symmetry after treating with botulinum toxin the healthy side of the face of 25 patients with long-standing facial paralysis who had previously been treated by surgical methods, with 6 months follow-up. Methods: Evaluation consisted of a clinical score, the two subscales of the Facial Disability Index, and surface electromyography. The mean botulinum toxin dose was 38 +/- 5 U (range = 15-69 U). Results: The clinical score showed significant reduction of asymmetry of 48.4\% at 1 month and 16.8\% after 6 months. The initial result was a consequence of reduced motion on the treated side combined with better motion on the paralyzed side. At 6 months, the treated side returned to basal scores. The residual effect seen in symmetry was due to an increase (18\%) of motion in the paralyzed side. There was a significant decrease in the action potential of muscles on the nonparalyzed side 1 month post injection but completely reverted after 6 months. The Physical Function Index increased, but not significantly. The Social/Well-Being Function Index showed a significant increase at 6 months compared to pretreatment. Conclusion: The proposed treatment improved facial symmetry for up to 6 months. Even after the end of the clinical effect of the drug, the paralyzed side's clinical score was 18\% higher than pretreatment, with an increased quality of life.},

	abstract = {Our aim was to describe our experience with the masseteric nerve in the reanimation of short term facial paralysis. We present our outcomes using a quantitative measurement system and discuss its advantages and disadvantages. Between 2000 and 2012, 23 patients had their facial paralysis reanimated by masseteric-facial coaptation. All patients are presented with complete unilateral paralysis. Their background, the aetiology of the paralysis, and the surgical details were recorded. A retrospective study of movement analysis was made using an automatic optical system (Facial Clima). Commissural excursion and commissural contraction velocity were also recorded. The mean age at reanimation was 43(8) years. The aetiology of the facial paralysis included acoustic neurinoma, fracture of the skull base, schwannoma of the facial nerve, resection of a cholesteatoma, and varicella zoster infection. The mean time duration of facial paralysis was 16(5) months. Follow-up was more than 2 years in all patients except 1 in whom it was 12 months. The mean duration to recovery of tone (as reported by the patient) was 67(11) days. Postoperative commissural excursion was 8(4)mm for the reanimated side and 8(3)mm for the healthy side (p=0.4). Likewise, commissural contraction velocity was 38(10)mm/s for the reanimated side and 43(12)mm/s for the healthy side (p=0.23). Mean percentage of recovery was 92(5)mm for commissural excursion and 79(15)mm/s for commissural contraction velocity. Masseteric nerve transposition is a reliable and reproducible option for the reanimation of short term facial paralysis with reduced donor site morbidity and good symmetry with the opposite healthy side.},

The temporalis muscle is a flat, fanshaped muscle with a generous blood supply and innervation from the trigeminal nerve. Methods and results: Based on our own experiences in a total of 25 cases (12 cases involving muscle transposition for mouth reanimation, six cases involving stabilisation of a duraplasty including protecting the internal carotid artery in one case, four cases involving reconstruction of the orbital floor or the base of the skull, and three cases involving recontouring the lateral face) and a review of the literature we give an up-to-date overview of the different indications for the temporalis muscle flap. These include: a) treatment of facial nerve paralysis, b) recontouring of the lateral face, c) reconstruction of skull base, orbita, and oropharynx, d) stabilization of duraplasty, e) protection of internal carotid artery, f) in temporomandibular joint surgery, and g) for obliteration in ear surgery.

	abstract = {Objective: To report a modification of the temporalis tendon transfer technique used in facial paralysis where dynamic adjacent muscle transfer is determined to be the best treatment option. Study design: Case series with chart review. Setting: Tertiary care teaching hospital. Subjects and methods: Review of 10 consecutive patients who underwent orthodromic transfer of the temporalis tendon and the attached coronoid process for the treatment of longstanding facial paralysis. Outcomes measured included patient satisfaction, measurements of oral commissure elevation with smiling, and grading of preoperative and postoperative patient photographs by objective physician observers. Reporting of complications. Results: Patient satisfaction was high, with a mean score of 7.0 (possible score of 10). Four patients were graded by the observer as excellent to superb. The other 6 patients were rated as having fair to good postoperative results. Movement was identified in every patient and ranged from 2.1 to 9.3 mm, with mean movement of the oral commissure of 5.12 mm. One patient developed a seroma at the site of harvest of the fascia that was drained without further complication. Conclusions: This facial reanimation procedure is a novel modification of the temporalis tendon transfer technique in which the coronoid process is transferred in conjunction with the tendon. This technique is minimally invasive and may result in less variability of the postoperative aesthetic result. The procedure allows orthodromic action of the temporalis muscle, is relatively easy to perform, and eliminates the facial asymmetry typically produced by transfer of the origin of the temporalis muscle.},

The literature was searched via Medline to reveal 186 additional case reports that were complete enough in their description to allow assessment of cranial nerve defects. Results: The group presenting for reanimation comprised 24 females and 5 males. All of the males had unilateral isolated facial nerve paralysis. Of the females, 9 had isolated unilateral palsy and 14 had bilateral palsy, and half of these were isolated. Six had bilateral abducens nerve palsy, fulfilling the original definition of M‚àö‚àÇbius syndrome. Of these, 3 had a right-sided hypoglossal weakness, one had a bilateral oculomotor palsy, and one had a bilateral trochlear palsy. One girl had bilateral facial and auditory involvement. The literature review revealed a group that was 60\% male, with 85\% having bilateral facial palsy. Abducens palsy was present in 68\%, glossopharyngeal in 28\%, hypoglossal in 26\%, and oculomotor in 20\%. The group was very heterogeneous in many ways. Conclusions: There are many theories of pathogenesis of this syndrome. Isolated facial palsy is in concordance with previous findings of nerve lesions within the temporal bone. Multiple cranial nerve defects are more likely to have brainstem lesions, related to prenatal ischemic events. The cranial nerve least likely to be involved was the accessory nerve, suggesting that this may be a reliable donor for reanimation procedures.},

Voluntary muscle activation was evaluated by electromyography (EMG) and clinical function was assessed both metrically from frontal photographs and by a rating system with 6 categories. Patient satisfaction was explored through a self-administered questionnaire of general health (SF-36 health survey). The average follow-up period was 49.3 months. All patients showed voluntary activation of the grafted muscles in the EMG. Symmetry of the static and dynamic position of the oral commissure at rest and under function was considerably improved. In general, however, there was a tendency for undercorrection particularly in a vertical direction. Under function, the excursion of the oral commissure on the grafted side reached 63.7\% and 65.5\% of the nonparetic side in vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. Subjective rating of patient well-being showed that the scores were higher than or comparable to those of healthy adults in six of eight areas of evaluation.},

We have retrospectively evaluated 60 patients who had facial animation procedures using the masseteric nerve during the last 10 years. The patients included those with recent, and established or congenital, unilateral and bilateral palsies. The masseteric nerve was used for coaptation of the facial nerve either alone or in association with crossfacial nerve grafting, or for the reinnervation of gracilis neuromuscular transplants. Reinnervation was successful in all cases, the mean (range) time being 4 (2-5) months for facial nerve coaptation and 4 (3-7) months for neuromuscular transplants. Cosmesis was evaluated (moderate, n=10, good, n=30, and excellent, n=20) as was functional outcome (no case of impairment of masticatory function, all patients able to smile, and achievement of a smile independent from biting). The masseteric nerve has many uses, including in both recent, and established or congenital, cases. In some conditions it is the first line of treatment.

	abstract = {Facial paralysis is a very disabling condition, both functionally and cosmetically. Despite the different methods of facial reanimation that have been described, there is no single method that will restore normal facial tone and motion. Of the methods available, primary neurorrhaphy is probably the most effective. The recovery period, however, is prolonged and, as a result, muscle tone and bulk may be lost. The hypoglossal-facial anastomosis is also a very reliable and effective technique but requires necessary interruption of both major cranial nerve trunks. Transfer of a neuromuscular pedicle (based on the ansa hypoglossi) has been offered as a method of facial reanimation that involves neither prolonged recovery nor interruption of the major cranial nerve functions. The application of this technique for reinnervation of a paralyzed larynx was first described by Tucker in 1970, and the technique was applied to facial muscle (in animal models) in 1977. The effectiveness of this technique–and its application in the management of facial paralysis in the human patient–remains controversial. We report our experience with a series of six patients who underwent neuromuscular pedicle transfer in conjunction with other more conventional methods of facial reanimation. The function of the pedicle and its contribution to the overall facial rehabilitation were assessed clinically and electromyographically. Factors influencing the success of the procedure and clinical and experimental evidence to support its application are discussed. While our experience with this technique is limited, it would appear that the neuromuscular pedicle transfer may play a useful adjunctive role in reanimation of the face in selective cases of facial paralysis.},

Twenty-seven of 40 patients aged 7 to 65 years (mean 40) operated on at Helsinki University Hospital between 1986 and 2000 were available for interview and video recording. The gracilis, latissimus dorsi, and serratus anterior muscles were used for microneurovascular transfer in 11, 10, and 6 cases, respectively.

Sixteen patients (59\%) displayed only mild or moderate dysfunction (grades 2 to 3) after reconstruction. In 8 patients (30\%) dysfunction was graded as moderately severe, and in 3 (11\%) as severe. There was a correlation between final functional outcome and the follow-up time after microneurovascular facial reanimation. The longer the follow-up time after muscle transplantation the poorer the functional result (p = 0.003). Twenty-one patients (78\%) considered that their quality of life was better or much better after facial reanimation. Patients' satisfaction correlated with a good functional result.},

Facial reanimation with free neuromuscular flaps is actually the accepted standard treatment. Two-stage procedures have been used for years, with a total flap recovery time of 18 to 24 months. In 1998, Harii proposed single-stage facial reanimation using the latissimus dorsi flap, showing a faster recovery compared with two-stage procedures. The present study evaluated the results of the authors' center applying the single-stage facial reanimation. Methods: From April of 1999 to April of 2006, 33 patients with unilateral established facial paralysis underwent single-stage facial reanimation via latissimus dorsi free flap transplantation. Time from the onset of paralysis ranged from 20 months to 64 years (mean, 11.6 years). Patients were followed postoperatively for at least 24 months. Results were studied and compared using Terzis and Noah's 1997 classification. Results: Among the 33 patients included in the study, there was an average reinnervation time of 8.9 months. According to Terzis and Noah's classification system, 12 patients (36.3 percent) were considered grade V, 12 (36.3 percent) were grade IV, four (12.2 percent) were grade III, two (6.1 percent) were grade II, and three (9.1 percent) were grade I. Conclusions: Single-stage facial reanimation with a latissimus dorsi flap achieved morphofunctional results similar to those obtained with the classic two-stage technique.

	abstract = {Background: Facial paralysis is a significant problem with functional, psychological, and esthetic consequences. Free muscle transfer for reanimation of the smile has been established as the preferred reconstructive method. However, little has been reported on the complications after this procedure. We sought to perform a critical analysis of these complications and their ultimate outcomes. Methods: A retrospective review was performed on consecutive patients undergoing microsurgical reconstruction of the smile by the senior author from 2013 through 2017. Patient demographics including age, race, body mass index, and medical comorbidities were recorded. The cause of facial palsy and type of microsurgical reconstruction were assessed. Patient outcomes including complications and management of the complication were analyzed. All statistical analyses were performed using nonparametric analyses. Results: We identified 17 patients who underwent microsurgical reconstruction of the smile, with 1 patient undergoing bilateral procedures, for a total of 18 microsurgical smile reanimation procedures performed. Sixteen of these were 1-stage reconstructions with the coaptation of the nerve to the masseter, whereas 2 were 2-stage reconstructions using cross-facial nerve grafts. The gracilis muscle was used as the donor muscle in all cases. The patients had a median age of 26.5 and a median follow-up of 1.04 years from surgery. There were no major early complications observed in our cohort. Eight (44.4\%) reanimations developed a minor complication that required subsequent reoperation. The reoperations were performed at a median of 0.97 years after the microsurgical procedure. The most common indication for reoperation was lateral retraction of the insertion of the transplanted muscle, which occurred in 5 (62.5\%) patients. One patient underwent surgical exploration for an abrupt loss of transplanted muscle function after trauma to the cheek. Another patient had less than expected transplanted muscle activity at 1 year postoperatively and underwent exploration of the cross-facial nerve graft and a neurorrhaphy revision. Lastly, 1 patient developed significant rhytids over the transplanted muscle secondary to tethering of the skin to the underlying muscle. This patient underwent 2 subsequent revisions, with placement of acellular dermal matrix between the muscle and skin and fat grafting. All patients had functional animation of the transplanted muscle postoperatively. Conclusions: Complications occurred in 44.4\% of patients undergoing microsurgical reanimation of the smile. Most complications were minor in nature and were readily addressed with advancement of the transplanted muscle. All patients in our series had muscle function after the muscle transplantation.},

	abstract = {Several techniques for static suspension of soft tissues in facial paralysis are available, including this use of the polypropylene (Marlex) mesh template. Through a standard rhytidectomy, lip and melolabial incisions, this template can be attached to the pivotal facial suspension points to bring about a selective and adjustable redistribution of the facial soft tissues. Although not meant to replace autogenous tissue use or physiologic reanimation procedures, this technique proved to be useful in three selective cases. The functional and cosmetic consequences of the polypropylene mesh template insertion on both a model and on three clinical patients with unilateral facial paralysis illustrate this technique. The concept of facial suspension along with its limitations, especially as it relates to template use and static facial suspension, are discussed.},

This technique is supposed to overcome loss of hypoglossal function. Methods: Tongue function in 39 consecutive patients and facial reanimation in 29 patients who completed 24 months follow-up were assessed. Facial nerve function was judged using the House-Brackmann (HB) grading system. Results: Tongue movements were normal in all operated on patients. Initial facial movements occurred on average 7.5 months postoperatively. The results were graded HB II in 6 (20.9\%), HB III in 13 (44.6\%), HB IV in 7 (24.1\%), HB V in 2 (6.8\%) patients, and HB VI in 1 (3.4\%) patient. The results were significantly better in young patients and when a short time interval between paralysis and surgery existed. Conclusions: Indirect hypoglossal-facial anastomosis is the preferred technique in most patients for whom the classical direct hypoglossofacial anastomosis is indicated.},

	title = {Detection and perceptual impact of side-to-side facial movement asymmetry},
	abstract = {Importance: In this study, we examined whether specific facial movements have different time-delay detection thresholds, and to what extent such side-to-side facial movement asymmetry affects subjective ratings of movement naturalness. Ratings of dynamic asymmetry in experimentally manipulated video recordings demonstrate that there are different side-to-side time-delay thresholds for distinct regions of the face, with a strong inverse correlation between naturalness rating and the length-of-time delay. These findings will be helpful for counseling patients with unilateral facial paralysis and guide the design of neural interfaces for facial reanimation. Objective: To determine the detection threshold of side-to-side facial movement timing asymmetry and measure its effect on perceived movement naturalness. Design, setting, and participants: Videos of 5 symmetrical facial movements (eye blink, rapid eyebrow raising, slow eyebrow raising, smiling, and lip depression) were edited to introduce 6 levels of side-to-side timing asymmetry, ranging from 33 to 267 milliseconds. Participants (N = 58) viewed video clips through an online survey service, indicating whether they noticed side-to-side asymmetry and judging movement naturalness on a 5-point scale. Results: There was a significant difference among facial movements in asymmetry detection threshold. There was a strong correlation between naturalness ratings and amount of delay across movements (R = 0.823), with greater asymmetry being judged as progressively less natural. Blink was judged as less natural at 33, 67, 100, and 133 milliseconds of side-to-side delay compared with all other movements (P {\textless} .005). Conclusions and relevance: Side-to-side asymmetry in blink timing is detected sooner and viewed as less natural compared with asymmetry of the eyebrow and lips. At 100 milliseconds of delay, nearly all movements are detected as asymmetric, although blink is judged as the least natural. These findings will help set timing goals for facial pacing technologies treating unilateral paralysis. Level of evidence: NA.},

In this article, the authors present a new surgical approach for patients with incomplete facial paralysis in which residual, ineffective movement is detected preoperatively in the ipsilateral buccozygomatic territory of the paretic facial nerve. Methods: Sixteen patients with incomplete facial paralysis were found eligible for the procedure and underwent one-stage facial reanimation performed by the senior author (E.G.). Reanimation was performed using free gracilis muscle transfer with neural coaptation to an active facial nerve branch(es) responsible for the predetected buccozygomatic residual movement. Patients were reviewed in a systematic fashion using a combined still photographic and video scoring scale for symmetry at rest and at dynamic states. Results: Following surgery, improved symmetry was observed in the majority of observations of the mouth region at rest and while smiling and of the nasolabial fold region while smiling. There was no significant change in symmetry in the majority of observations of the eye region at rest and while smiling and the nasolabial fold region at rest. Video assessment of dynamic facial symmetry while smiling demonstrated improved symmetry in 91 percent of the observations (n = 191 observations). Comparison of mean scores for dynamic smile symmetry produced a statistically significant improvement of 1.68 points following surgery (p {\textless} 0.001). Conclusion: Based on this series, the authors recommend that use of the ipsilateral facial nerve buccozygomatic residual branch be considered as a donor nerve for facial reanimation using a free gracilis muscle transfer in patients with incomplete facial paralysis with residual preoperative movement in the miDFace.

We define a "successful smile" as one that is rated effective, genuine, and pleasant in the colloquial sense of these words. We found that a successful smile can be expressed via a variety of different spatiotemporal trajectories, involving an intricate balance of mouth angle, smile extent, and dental show combined with dynamic symmetry. These findings have broad applications in a variety of areas, such as facial reanimation surgery, rehabilitation, computer graphics, and psychology.},

Methods: A standardized evaluation method for assessing the recovery after FFMT to reanimate the paralyzed face with at least a 1-year follow-up was applied. The evaluation included the following 5 stages: no movement, dependent movement, independent movement, and spontaneous movement with and without involuntary movement. Reliability of this technique was assessed by 3 examiners, who each evaluated the smiles of 30 unilateral facial paralysis patients 4 times, creating 360 sets of measurements. Results: The intraclass correlation coefficients for interrater and intrarater reliability exceeded 0.929, which is considered excellent and reliable.

	abstract = {Background: Masseter-to-facial nerve transfer is a highly efficient technique for reanimating paralyzed muscle and has been reported to restore facial symmetry at rest. However, no systematic studies have been performed, and the effects of preoperative droop of the oral commissure on postoperative symmetry at rest have rarely been reported. Methods: The authors retrospectively analyzed 35 patients with masseteric-to-facial nerve anastomosis and assessed the quality and quantity of the dynamic recovery and the oral commissure symmetry at rest. The dynamic and static effects were then compared. Results: All of the patients' Terzis scores were increased postoperatively, and over half of the patients presented restored symmetric smiles (Terzis scores of 4 or 5). The postoperative symmetry scale of the oral commissure at rest improved in 18 of 35 patients. Both the mean postoperative altitude difference of oral commissure excursion and the postoperative altitude difference of bilateral oral commissure position were decreased compared with preoperative values. The preoperative symmetry had a significant effect on the postoperative altitude difference of the bilateral oral commissure position. The effects of the dynamic and static symmetry improvements were transformed to a comparable factor ‚âà√≠¬¨¬±. The dynamic ‚âà√≠¬¨¬± was significantly greater than the static ‚âà√≠¬¨¬±. Conclusions: Masseter-to-facial nerve transfer is a reliable technique for smile reanimation. However, it has only a limited effect on the improvement of symmetry at rest. Assessing the preoperative symmetry of the oral commissure at rest can be used to predict postoperative outcomes, and patients with severe droop of the oral commissure (symmetry scale grade III or IV) should receive static suspension.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Facial paralysis has a profound impact on functionality and esthetics of the oral region. In patients with strong skin laxity and soft tissue ptosis, functional smile reconstruction is challenging due to the accentuated asymmetry at rest. Thus, the purpose of the study was to analyze facial symmetry in this patient clientele following a combination of dynamic reanimation with fascial strips for static suspension compared to functional gracilis transfer alone. Methods: In 2014, we altered the single-stage approach for microsurgical smile reconstruction in patients with significant soft tissue ptosis by adding fascia lata grafts for static support. We evaluated 6 patients (mean age 57.8 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 5.2, group A) who underwent the combined procedure, and compared their results to 6 patients with flaccid facial paralysis who were treated before 2014 and received a functional gracilis transfer alone (mean age 52.5 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 7.5, group B). To test the efficacy of the technique, we retrospectively analyzed the correction of the oral asymmetry as well as nasal and philtral deviation by computer-assisted photograph analysis 6 months postoperatively. Results: The comparative analysis revealed a significant postoperative improvement of the oral asymmetry (A: 90.0 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 5.0\% relative correction at rest vs. B: 62.6 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 17.2\%, P {\textless} .05), nasal (A: 0.4 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 0.2 vs. B: 0.7 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 0.4 mm, P {\textless} .05), and philtral deviation (A: 0.5 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 0.6 vs. B: 2.8 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 1.8 mm, P {\textless} .05) in group A. Conclusions: The combined procedure for dynamic facial reanimation allows for immediate correction of the oral asymmetry and improves overall outcome in patients with advanced soft tissue ptosis and oral asymmetry at rest.},

	abstract = {We conducted a retrospective case review at our tertiary care academic medical center to assess the long-term results of microvascular free-tissue transfer to achieve facial reanimation in 3 patients. These patients had undergone wide-field parotidectomy with facial nerve resection. Upper facial reanimation was accomplished with a proximal facial nerve-sural nerve graft, and lower facial movement was achieved through proximal facial nerve-long thoracic (serratus muscle) nerve anastomosis. Outcomes were determined by grading postoperative facial nerve function according to the House-Brackmann system. All 3 patients were able to close their eyes independent of lower facial movement, and all 3 had achieved House-Brackmann grade III function. We conclude that reanimating the paralyzed face with microvascular free-tissue transfer provides anatomic coverage and mimetic function after wide-field parotidectomy. Synkinesis is reduced by separating upper- and lower-division reanimation.},

	abstract = {Cross face nerve grafting followed by free muscle transfer has become a standard of care in rehabilitation of the paralyzed face. In an effort to address the surgical morbidity of sural nerve harvest, multiple groups have attempted to minimize lower extremity trauma from sural nerve harvest. In very preliminary studies, investigators have adapted the use of vein harvesting equipment for harvest of the sural nerve. In this article we describe the use of endoscopic vein harvesting equipment for sural nerve harvest in a series of eight patients undergoing facial reanimation, in which a single distal incision is made posterior to the lateral malleolus. Eight patients presented for first-stage cross face nerve grafting for facial reanimation over a 6-month period. Each patient was operated on using a two-team approach. One team exposed the donor branches of the facial nerve on the healthy side while the endoscopic harvest was simultaneously executed in the lower limb by the second team. In each case, the sural nerve graft {\textgreater} 20 cm in length was removed through a single 1.5-cm incision. There were no complications. Operative times decreased steadily throughout the period examined and were {\textless} 20 minutes for the last two patients. For the final two cases, a modified sural nerve stripper was introduced through the instrument portal of the VasoView device (Guidant Co., Natick, MA), which contained a small notch through which the nerve could be threaded, greatly facilitating dissection. This contributed to decreasing operative times. Thus we combined the technological advances of a sophisticated endoscopic system with our minimally invasive nerve stripper technique to improve sural nerve harvest. We found no increased morbidity from the endoscopic approach, and in all cases we were able to remove the nerve through a single incision. The endoscopic sural nerve harvest is an excellent addition to the armamentarium of the facial reanimation surgeon.},

The age of the patients ranged from 21 to 74 years. Denervation time (Dt) ranged from 8 months to 42 years. Eight patients had partial facial paralysis, and 49 patients had complete facial paralysis. The results were based on the functional and electromyography (EMG) scoring of the neurotised muscles showing an overall EMG mean improvement of 26.56\% in eye closure, 34.47\% in smile restoration and 32.67\% in depressor function by the procedure. Median improvement in all facial functions was one grade (25\%) in theTerzis grading systems regarding the respective facial functions. The prerequisites are Dt less than 6 months and a functional contralateral facial nerve. In cases where Dt is more than 27 months and preoperative EMG's are silent, a free or pedicled muscle should be used to substitute the denervated native facial muscle. Promoting expressivity and augmenting facial muscle function using direct muscle neurotisation are important components in facial reanimation.},

This article presents the results achieved by free functional muscle transplantation for reconstruction of the paralyzed face, registered by three-dimensional video analysis of facial movements. Methods: Of patients treated consecutively between 1997 and 2006, two groups were constituted: group 1 comprised 22 patients with reinnervation completed after a single cross-face nerve graft and a free gracilis muscle graft for reconstruction of the smile; group 2 comprised nine patients treated with two cross-face nerve grafts followed by a territorially differentiated gracilis muscle transplant for reconstruction of the smile and eye closure. Smiling with showing teeth, maximal showing of teeth, and closing the eyes as in sleep were analyzed in detail. Results: In group 1, static asymmetry was reduced from 12.19 +/- 8.73 mm preoperatively to -1.84 +/- 7.67 mm at 18 months postoperatively. Smile amplitude increased from 9 to 60 percent of that on the healthy side in 10 incomplete facial palsies of this group, and from 0 to 62 percent in eight functionally successful muscle grafts among 11 patients with complete lesions. In group 2, static asymmetry improved from 7.24 +/- 12.64 mm to -5.36 +/- 9.07 mm; the overcorrection was intentional. Movement was improved in eight cases. Smile amplitude reached 68 +/- 43 percent of that on the normal side. Lagophthalmus improved from 7.21 +/- 3.59 mm to 1.38 +/- 2.49 mm.

Lengthening temporalis myoplasty is a widely used technique for correction of facial asymmetry in facial palsy. The aim of this study was to determine whether lengthening temporalis myoplasty could reduce the dysfunction in the oral phase of swallowing in patients with facial palsy. Materials and methods: This prospective study enrolled 13 patients undergoing lengthening temporalis myoplasty. Lip continence, bolus residue, and perceived disability before surgery and at 3 months and 6 months after surgery were compared. Lip force was evaluated with a manometric test and drooling with a self-administered questionnaire. Bolus residue was assessed visually. Perceived disability was evaluated using a self-administered questionnaire. Results: Lip force improved significantly (from 58.23 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 23.35 mmHg to 91.15 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 18.36 mmHg; p = 0.001). Drooling showed a corresponding reduction, with the score decreasing from 4.31 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 1.8 to 3 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 1.41; p = 0.025.

The authors' goal was to develop a measurement system that is simple, uses commercially available equipment, takes little time, and provides meaningful and accurate measurements. This technique is called the facial reanimation measurement system. It involves placing dots around the patient's mouth and video recording the patient performing maximal effort smiles. Using a video editing program, one frame showing the patient at rest is overlaid with a second frame showing the patient's smile. This overlaid image is imported into Adobe PhotoShop, where measurements are obtained using tools available in the program. Twenty patients were used to test interrater and intrarater reliability of the facial reanimation measurement system. The accuracy of the measurement process was tested by comparing 10 known distances and angles with those obtained using the facial reanimation measurement system. Both intrarater and interrater reliability of the distance and angle measurements are highly accurate, with intraclass correlations greater than 0.9. The facial reanimation measurement system is accurate to within 0.6 mm and 2.0 degrees when compared with a "known" distance and angle. The facial reanimation measurement system has been used to measure smile movements of more than 200 patients and has been demonstrated to be valuable for detecting changes of facial movements over time. This system is simple and economical and only requires 20 minutes to perform. Although the authors demonstrated evaluation of smile movement, the system may be used to evaluate other movements, such as mouth puckering, eye closure, and forehead elevation.},

A retrospective study was performed on 23 patients treated between 1988 and 1997 at the 2nd and 4th ENT chairs of University "La Sapienza" of Rome for facial palsy following cerebellopontine angle surgery. Tumors included acoustic neuromas (n = 3). Seventeen patients underwent hypoglossal-facial anastomoses [10 with end-to-end anastomoses, 4 with May's interposition "jump-nerve" grafts and 3 with partial (30\%) use of the hypoglossal nerve plus a facial cross-over]. The remaining patients were operated on using a cable graft with the sural nerve (n = 2) and the great auricular nerve (n = 4). Postoperative facial function was determined by the House-Brackmann 6-scale classification The hypoglossal-facial anastomoses resulted in long-term grade III or IV findings. Cable grafts improved facial function from grade VI to grade III. None of the patients operated on with the moDFied VII-XII anastomosis developed swallowing disturbances. The ten patients having traditional hypoglossal-facial anastomoses showed different degrees of tongue disability and retention of residue in the oral cavity. Surgical recovery of postoperative facial palsy can be obtained with various techniques according to the availability of the proximal facial nerve stump at the brain stem. Since a traditional hypoglossal-facial anastomosis procedure can be a source of a separate disability for the patient, techniques are preferred that leave the hypoglossal nerve mostly intact and uncompromised.},

	title = {Masseteric-facial nerve neurorrhaphy: results of a case series},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Facial palsy is a well-known functional and esthetic problem that bothers most patients and affects their social relationships. When the time between the onset of paralysis and patient presentation is less than 18 months and the proximal stump of the injured facial nerve is not available, another nerve must be anastomosed to the facial nerve to reactivate its function. The masseteric nerve has recently gained popularity over the classic hypoglossus nerve as a new motor source because of its lower associated morbidity rate and the relative ease with which the patient can activate it. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effectiveness of masseteric-facial nerve neurorrhaphy for early facial reanimation. METHODS Thirty-four consecutive patients (21 females, 13 males) with early unilateral facial paralysis underwent masseteric-facial nerve neurorrhaphy in which an interpositional nerve graft of the great auricular or sural nerve was placed. The time between the onset of paralysis and surgery ranged from 2 to 18 months (mean 13.3 months). Electromyography revealed mimetic muscle fibrillations in all the patients. Before surgery, all patients had House-Brackmann Grade VI facial nerve dysfunction. Twelve months after the onset of postoperative facial nerve reactivation, each patient underwent a clinical examination using the modified House-Brackmann grading scale as a guide. RESULTS Overall, 91.2\% of the patients experienced facial nerve function reactivation. Facial recovery began within 2-12 months (mean 6.3 months) with the restoration of facial symmetry at rest. According to the modified House-Brackmann grading scale, 5.9\% of the patients had Grade I function, 61.8\% Grade II, 20.6\% Grade III, 2.9\% Grade V, and 8.8\% Grade VI. The morbidity rate was low; none of the patients could feel the loss of masseteric nerve function. There were only a few complications, including 1 case of postoperative bleeding (2.9\%) and 2 local infections (5.9\%), and a few patients complained about partial loss of sensitivity of the earlobe or a small area of the ankle and foot, depending on whether great auricular or sural nerves were harvested. CONCLUSIONS The surgical technique described here seems to be efficient for the early treatment of facial paralysis and results in very little morbidity.},

	abstract = {Bilateral facial palsy in M‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√ábius syndrome remains one of the greatest challenges in reconstructive plastic surgery. Facial reanimation is an invaluable aid to such patients because it allows for greater social interaction by means of the ability to smile. In performing facial reanimation surgery on patients with M‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√ábius syndrome, it is the observation of the senior author (Harrison) that upper labial deficiency is a consistent and previously unreported feature of the syndrome. It has been the practice of the senior author to perform upper labial augmentation on M‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√ábius syndrome patients by insertion of a lipodermal autograft, in addition to facial reanimation. Nine patients with M‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√ábius syndrome who presented to the Department of Plastic Surgery during an 8-year period were reviewed. All nine possessed bilateral facial palsy and upper labial deficiency in addition to other abnormalities consistent with M‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√ábius syndrome. Six patients underwent bilateral facial reanimation and upper labial augmentation alone. One patient refused facial reanimation surgery but consented to upper labial augmentation. One patient, with concomitant micrognathia, underwent bilateral facial reanimation, upper labial augmentation, and insertion of a Silastic chin implant. In one patient, a child who also exhibited micrognathia, bilateral facial reanimation alone was carried out, with further procedures for upper labial and chin cosmesis being postponed until adulthood. The indication for performing upper labial augmentation was cosmetic. The procedure improved upper labial appearance and restored balance to the mouth. Patients also expressed higher satisfaction with eating and drinking, which they related to the improved fullness of the upper lip. This was before the facial reanimation had become functional. Upper labial deficiency warrants addition to the list of facial features of M‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√ábius syndrome and is something that must be assessed in the context of facial reanimation surgery.},

	abstract = {Background: Radical tumor ablation in the periauricular area often results in extensive soft tissue defects, including facial nerve sacrifice, bone and/or dura defects. Reconstruction of these defects should aim at restoring facial reanimation, wound closure, and facial and neck contours. We present our experience using free anterolateral thigh flap (ALT) in combination with masseter nerve to facial nerve transfer in managing complex defects in the periauricular area. Methods: Between 2011 and 2015 six patients underwent a combined procedure of ALT flap reconstruction and masseter nerve transfer, to reconstruct extensive, post tumor resection, periauricular defects. The ALT flap was customized according to the defect. For smile restoration, the masseter nerve was transferred to the buccal branch of the facial nerve. If the facial nerve stump was preserved, interposition of nerve grafts to the zygomatic and frontal branches was performed to provide separate eye closure. The outcomes were analyzed by assessing wound closure, contour deformity, symmetry of the face, and facial nerve function. Results: There were no partial or total flap losses. Stable wound closure and adequate volume replacement in the neck was achieved in all cases, as well as good facial tonus and symmetry. The mean follow-up time of clinical outcomes was 16.8 months. Smile restoration was graded as good or excellent in four cases, moderate in one and fair in one. Conclusion: Extensive periauricular defects following oncologic resection could be adequately reconstructed in a combined procedure of free ALT flap and masseter nerve transfer to the facial nerve for smile restoration.},

A new nerve coaptation strategy is presented herein. We performed a 1-stage double-powered free gracilis muscle flap transfer in a patient with long-standing facial paralysis by splitting the obturator nerve and anastomosing the 2 free ends to the contralateral facial nerve (through a sural graft) and to the masseteric nerve. Voluntary movement of the transferred muscle with teeth clenching was observed at 6 months after the operation and a symmetric smile with bilateral elevation of the mouth angle at 10 months. Our limited experience suggests that in case of a large cross-section of the obturator nerve, the latter can be split and sutured to the ipsilateral masseteric nerve and to the contralateral facial nerve with a sural graft by double end-to-end anastomosis.},

	title = {Dynamic reconstruction of eye closure by muscle transposition or functional muscle transplantation in facial palsy},
	abstract = {For patients with facial palsy, lagophthalmus is often a more serious problem than the inability to smile. Dynamic reconstruction of eye closure by muscle transposition or by free functional muscle transplantation offers a good solution for regaining near-normal eye protection without the need for implants. This is the first quantitative study of three-dimensional preoperative and postoperative lid movements in patients treated for facial paralysis. Between February of 1998 and April of 2002, 44 patients were treated for facial palsy, including reconstruction of eye closure. Temporalis muscle transposition to the eye was used in 34 cases, and a regionally differentiated part of a free gracilis muscle transplant after double cross-face nerve grafting was used in 10 cases. Patients' facial movements were documented by a three-dimensional video analysis system preoperatively and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively. For this comparative study, only the data of patients with preoperative and 12-month postoperative measurements were included. In the 27 patients with a final result after temporalis muscle transposition for eye closure, the distance between the upper and lower eyelid points during eye closing (as for sleep) was reduced from 10.33 +/- 2.43 mm (mean +/- SD) preoperatively to 5.84 +/- 4.34 mm postoperatively on the paralyzed side, compared with 0.0 +/- 0.0 mm preoperatively and postoperatively on the contralateral healthy side. In the resting position, preoperative values for the paralyzed side changed from 15.11 +/- 1.92 mm preoperatively to 13.46 +/- 1.94 mm postoperatively, compared with 12.17 +/- 2.02 mm preoperatively and 12.05 +/- 1.95 mm postoperatively on the healthy side. In the nine patients with a final result after surgery using a part of the free gracilis muscle transplant reinnervated by a zygomatic branch of the contralateral healthy side through a cross-face nerve graft, eyelid closure changed from 10.21 +/- 2.72 mm to 1.68 +/- 1.35 mm, compared with 13.70 +/- 1.56 mm to 6.63 +/- 1.51 mm preoperatively. The average closure for the healthy side was from 11.20 +/- 3.11 mm to 0.0 +/- 0.0 mm preoperatively and from 12.70 +/- 1.95 mm to 0.0 +/- 0.0 mm postoperatively. In three cases, the resting tonus of the part of the gracilis muscle transplant around the eye had increased to an extent that muscle weakening became necessary. Temporalis muscle transposition and free functional muscle transplantation for reanimation of the eye and mouth at the same time are reliable methods for reconstructing eye closure, with clinically adequate results. Detailed analysis of the resulting facial movements led to an important improvement of the authors' operative techniques within the last few years. Thus, the number of secondary operative corrections could be significantly reduced. These qualitative and quantitative studies of the reconstructed lid movements by three-dimensional video analysis support the authors' clinical concept of temporalis muscle transposition being the first-choice method in adult patients with facial palsy. In children, free muscle transplantation is preferred for eye closure, so as not to interfere with the growth of the face by transposition of a masticatory muscle. In addition, a higher degree of central plasticity in children might be expected.},

	abstract = {Background: Neurovascular free muscle transfer is one of the main reconstructive options for established or long-standing facial paralysis. The two-stage gracilis muscle transfer combined with the cross-face nerve graft (two-stage method) has been supplanted by one-stage reconstruction using the latissimus dorsi muscle (LD) at our institution. This study retrospectively evaluated the results of one-stage LD transfer. Methods: Between September 1993 and December 2008, 344 patients (133 males, 211 females; age range, 5-75 years) with unilateral facial paralysis underwent 351 one-stage LD transfers. Patients were evaluated with a custom grading scale. Differences in grading scale score were compared according to age, past surgical history and the duration from operation to neuromuscular recovery. Results: Contraction of the transferred muscle was recognised in 305 (87.0\%) transfers. The duration until neuromuscular recovery ranged from 3 to 16 months (average ¬¨¬± standard deviation: 6.48 ¬¨¬± 1.92 months). The grading scale was significantly lower in middle-age group than in younger and elder groups (P {\textless} 0.01). Duration until neuromuscular recovery was significantly different when comparing the younger group and the oldest group. There was no difference in grading scale score or in duration until neuromuscular recovery when comparing the patients with a past surgical history and those without. The grading scale negatively correlated with the duration until neuromuscular recovery. Conclusions: The results are consistent and statistical analysis revealed the versatility of the one-stage LD transfer. Although we believe the two-stage method is still a good option for facial reanimation, the one-stage method is advantageous regarding the shorter period of recovery and little donor-site morbidity.},

	abstract = {Consistent and objective evaluation of the paralyzed face is imperative for documenting preoperative findings and assessing postoperative outcomes of reanimation techniques. Static and dynamic facial asymmetry are the key features of the paralyzed face. To date, there is no consensus among surgeons on how best to document facial asymmetry. The authors propose a Facial Asymmetry Index (FAI) as an objective measure of facial asymmetry and validate its use and reliability across numerous reanimation techniques. Frontal photographs of patients with unilateral facial nerve paralysis were analyzed. The length from the medial canthus to the ipsilateral oral commissure was compared between affected and nonaffected sides. The FAI is the difference between the two values, with a higher value reflecting poorer facial symmetry. Validation and reliability testing was then performed. There was a consistent decrease in the FAI with procedural intervention (FAI pre = 10.1, FAI post = 3.17; p {\textless} 0.0001). Furthermore, there was excellent inter- and intrarater reliability among independent judges. The FAI is a powerful and accessible tool to quantify operative outcomes for many lower facial nerve reanimation techniques.},

	abstract = {Lower lip depression was historically regarded a neglected area of facial paralysis, but, with refinement of techniques, has gained increasing attention. We present the first detailed description and evaluation of a 2-stage technique, using first cross facial nerve graft and then the anterior belly of digastric muscle (ABDM), innervated by the cross facial nerve graft, to restore dynamic and spontaneous lower lip depression. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 2-stage lower lip reanimations between 2010 and 2018 was performed. Demographics, etiology, and operative details were recorded. Videos were graded pre/postoperatively using a 5-point Likert scale by 21 independent observers. Objective changes of symmetry were analyzed using Photogrammetry (Emotrics). Results: Twenty-seven patients were identified (median age 34.9 years, range 6-64). The mean duration between the 2 stages was 15.1 months. Follow-up ranged from 18-72 months. There were minor complications in 4 patients, and 1 case was abandoned due to insufficient length of anterior belly of digastric muscle. Average peer-reviewed scores improved from 2.1 to 3.2 (P {\textless} 0.05). Emotrics did not show improvement in static symmetry (P {\textgreater} 0.05). However, during open-lip smiling, lower lip height improved significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) whilst dental show improvements approached significance (P {\textless} 0.08). Lower lip symmetry was also improved during lower lip depression, as shown by improvements in lower lip height (P {\textless} 0.05), smile angle, and dental show (both P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions: These results show the safety and efficacy of 2-stage lower lip reanimation using anterior belly of digastric muscle transposition.

	abstract = {Background: In facial reanimation via microneurovascular muscle transfer, dual-nerve reinnervation of the muscle capitalizes on the synergistic effects of spontaneous motion from cross facial nerve grafting (CFNG) and increased excursion from masseteric nerve transfer. Two-stage approaches that delay masseteric nerve transfer until the time of the muscle flap increase spontaneity by maximizing muscle reinnervation from the CFNG. While this 2-stage, dual-nerve approach has been described in adults, we present a series of pediatric patients who underwent this reconstructive technique. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all pediatric patients who underwent 2-stage, dual-nerve reconstruction with CFNG and ipsilateral masseteric nerve transfers. Procedures were performed between 2004 and 2016 by 2 surgeons at a single centre. Degree of facial paralysis before and after surgical intervention was measured using House-Brackmann scores. Results: Nine patients with a mean age of 8.6 (range: 5-15 years) years at time of surgery underwent 2-stage, dual-nerve reconstruction. Average time between CFNG and transfer of the free gracilis with masseteric nerve transfer was 13.3 (SD 2.4) months. Mean follow-up was 27.3 months (SD 25.7). Patients demonstrated initiation of voluntary movement on paralyzed side by 3.6 months (SD 0.6) on average, with 3 patients demonstrating spontaneous movement at 3 months. Conclusion: The 2-stage, dual innervation technique using CFNG and delayed ipsilateral masseteric nerve transfer with a free gracilis is a promising reconstructive option to maximize spontaneous expression in pediatric patients. Validated, objective scoring systems for excursion are needed before meaningful comparisons can be made to other reconstructive strategies.},

	abstract = {Background: The inability to smile stands out as a notable difficulty for individuals with facial nerve palsies; a problem that facial reanimation surgery aims to rectify. However, smile reconstruction currently lacks quantitative data by which to objectively measure outcomes. This study aims to identify the relative importance of different oral muscles in terms of smiling, and explore the percentage function that needs to be restored for a smile to be perceived by an observer. Methods: A computer animation tool was developed to model the oral facial muscles and demonstrate the facial expressions produced by contraction of different muscle groups. By programming a variable unilateral paralysis of the zygomaticus major, the effects of 0-100\% function of this muscle can also be seen in a further set of animations using the basic muscular structure of a smile to produce a computerized proxy smile. These animations were shown to 75 adults from the general population who reported those expressions they perceived as a smile. Results: The only facial expression consistently associated with a perceived smile was caused by the combined contraction of the zygomaticus major and the levator anguli oris (P {\textless} 0.001). This concurs with previously reported observations of the human smile. Over 70\% of the subjects were able to perceive a smile with just 40\% function of the unilateral paralyzed zygomaticus major. Conclusions: These results present an objective target for facial reanimation surgery by which outcomes may be measured. This computerized model also provides a valuable tool for patient education during pre-operative consent.},

The use of an interposition graft and its end-to-side anastomosis to the hypoglossal nerve allows the preservation of the tongue function and also requires two anastomosis sites and a free second donor nerve. We describe the modified technique of the hypoglossal-facial-jump-anastomosis without an interposition and present the first results. Study design: Retrospective case study. Methods: We performed the facial nerve reconstruction in five patients. The indication for the surgery was a long-standing facial paralysis with preserved portion distal to geniculate ganglion, absent voluntary activity in the needle facial electromyography, and an intact bilateral hypoglossal nerve. Following mastoidectomy, the facial nerve was mobilized in the fallopian canal down to its bifurcation in the parotid gland and cut in its tympanic portion distal to the lesion. Then, a tensionless end-to-side suture to the hypoglossal nerve was performed. The facial function was monitored up to 16 months postoperatively. Results: The reconstruction technique succeeded in all patients: The facial function improved within the average time period of 10 months to the House-Brackmann score 3.

Society's perception of the health utility of varying degrees of facial paralysis and the value society places on reconstructive surgery for facial reanimation need to be quantified. Objective: To measure health state utility of varying degrees of facial paralysis, willingness to pay (WTP) for a repair, and the subsequent value of facial reanimation surgery as perceived by society. Design, setting, and participants: This prospective observational study conducted in an academic tertiary referral center evaluated a group of 348 casual observers who viewed images of faces with unilateral facial paralysis of 3 severity levels (low, medium, and high) categorized by House-Brackmann grade. Structural equation modeling was performed to understand associations among health utility metrics, WTP, and facial perception domains. Data were collected from July 16 to September 26, 2015. Main outcomes and measures: Observer-rated (1) quality of life (QOL) using established health utility metrics (standard gamble, time trade-off, and a visual analog scale) and (2) their WTP for surgical repair. Results: Among the 348 observers (248 women [71.3\%]; 100 men [28.7\%]; mean [SD] age, 29.3 [11.6] years), mixed-effects linear regression showed that WTP increased nonlinearly with increasing severity of paralysis. Participants were willing to pay \$3487 (95\% CI, \$2362-\$4961) to repair low-grade paralysis, \$8571 (95\% CI, \$6401-\$11 234) for medium-grade paralysis, and \$20 431 (95\% CI, \$16 273-\$25 317) for high-grade paralysis. The dominant factor affecting the participants' WTP was perceived QOL. Modeling showed that perceived QOL decreased with paralysis severity (regression coefficient, -0.004; 95\% CI, -0.005 to -0.004; P {\textless} .001) and increased with attractiveness (regression coefficient, 0.002; 95\% CI, 0.002 to 0.003; P {\textless} .001).

We calculated mean (SD) WTP per quality-adjusted life-year, which ranged from \$10 167 (\$14 565) to \$17 008 (\$38 288) for low- to high-grade paralysis, respectively. Conclusions and relevance: Society perceives the repair of facial paralysis to be a high-value intervention. Societal WTP increases and perceived health state utility decreases with increasing House-Brackmann grade. This study demonstrates the usefulness of WTP as an objective measure to inform dimensions of disease severity and signal the value society places on proper facial function. Level of evidence: NA.},

	title = {Management of vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas): auditory and facial nerve function after resection of 120 vestibular schwannomas in patients with neurofibromatosis 2},
	abstract = {Objective: Vestibular schwannomas (VSs) affect young patients with Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF-2) and cause very serious problems for hearing, facial expression, and brain stem function. Our objective was to determine a therapy concept for the right timing and indication of neurosurgical therapy. Methods: In 1000 consecutive VS resections, 120 tumors in 82 patients with NF-2 were surgically treated by the same surgeon (MS) at the Department of Neurosurgery at Nordstadt Hospital from 1978 to 1993. The mean age of the patients was 27.5 years. Sixty tumors were surgically treated in 41 male patients, and 60 tumors were surgically treated in 41 female patients. Bilateral tumor resection was performed in 38 patients (76 operations, after previous partial surgery in 15 cases elsewhere), and unilateral operations were performed in 44 patients, 5 of whom had undergone ipsi- or contralateral surgery that was performed elsewhere. The operative and clinical findings are evaluated and compared with the data of patients without NF-2. Results: In 105 cases, complete tumor resections were achieved. In 15 cases, deliberate subtotal resections were performed. These were for brain stem decompression in 4 cases and for hearing preservation in the last hearing ear in 11 cases, with successful preservation in 8 of the 11. Pre- and postoperative hearing rates were higher in male than in female patients (70\% in male versus 65\% in female patients before surgery and 40.5 versus 31\%, respectively, after surgery). Hearing was preserved in 29 of 81 ears (36\%). The rate of preservation was 24\% in cases of large tumors and 57\% in cases of small tumors ({\textless}30 mm). Twenty-one of 82 patients (26\%) were bilaterally deaf before surgery. Twenty-five patients had uni- or bilateral hearing after surgery (i.e., 41 \% of those with preoperative hearing or 30.5\% of the whole group). Anatomic facial nerve preservation was achieved in 85\%. The facial nerve was reconstructed intracranially at the cerebellopontine angle by sural grafting in 17 cases and by hypoglossal-facial reanimation in 5. Two deaths occurred 1 and 3 months postsurgically as a result of malignant tumor growth with brain stem dysfunction and respiratory problems. In summary, for patients with NF-2, the presentation ages are lower, tumor progression is faster, the chances of anatomic and functional nerve preservation are lower, the chances of good outcomes are best when surgery is performed early and when there is good preoperative hearing function, and the danger of sudden hearing loss is higher. The chances and danger often differ from side to side among individual patients. Conclusion: The indication and the timing of tumor resections are in some respects different from normal VS handling and are dependent on the tumor extension and related necessity of brain stem decompression and on the auditory function. As an optimal goal, completeness of resection with functional cochlear nerve preservation is formulated, and as an acceptable compromise, subtotal microsurgical resection with functional cochlear nerve preservation in the last hearing ear is suggested.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Data on treatment outcomes of surgical correction of irreversible facial paralysis is rare and long-term outcomes are scarce in the literature, making treatment choices difficult for operating surgeons. Objective: This study evaluated 25-year outcomes of treatment of irreversible facial paralysis with Gillies and McLaughlin techniques with a focus on general functional and age-related functional outcomes. Methods: Data of all patients who underwent surgical correction of facial paralysis using either Gillies or McLaughlin procedure between 1994 and 2018 were included in the analysis of this retrospective, single-centre study (n = 154). Results: Gillies surgery was performed on 12 and McLaughlin technique on 33 patients. Gillies and McLaughlin surgeries were associated with high patient satisfaction (75-86\%), low complication rates (8-24\%), and achievement of full or partial eyelid closure in 75\% as well as smile reanimation in 97\% of patients operated. Achievement of resting facial symmetry was low for both techniques and ranged from 27 to 46\%. Age-related functional outcomes were generally superior in middle-aged patients (21-59 years) with fewer complications and reoperations compared to younger and older patients. Conclusions: Surgical correction with Gillies or McLaughlin dynamic muscle support techniques yielded good clinical results with high patient satisfaction and should, therefore, be included as a treatment option for facial reanimation of irreversible facial paralysis. Patient age may play a role in treatment outcomes and reoperation and complication rates and should be taken into careful consideration during treatment planning.},

	title = {Outcome of different facial nerve reconstruction techniques},
	abstract = {Introduction: There is no technique of facial nerve reconstruction that guarantees facial function recovery up to grade III. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of different facial nerve reconstruction techniques. Methods: Facial nerve reconstruction was performed in 22 patients (facial nerve interpositional graft in 11 patients and hypoglossal-facial nerve transfer in another 11 patients). All patients had facial function House-Brackmann (HB) grade VI, either caused by trauma or after resection of a tumor. All patients were submitted to a primary nerve reconstruction except 7 patients, where late reconstruction was performed two weeks to four months after the initial surgery. The follow-up period was at least two years. Results: For facial nerve interpositional graft technique, we achieved facial function HB grade III in eight patients and grade IV in three patients. Synkinesis was found in eight patients, and facial contracture with synkinesis was found in two patients. In regards to hypoglossal-facial nerve transfer using different modifications, we achieved facial function HB grade III in nine patients and grade IV in two patients. Facial contracture, synkinesis and tongue atrophy were found in three patients, and synkinesis was found in five patients. However, those who had primary direct facial-hypoglossal end-to-side anastomosis showed the best result without any neurological deficit. Conclusion: Among various reanimation techniques, when indicated, direct end-to-side facial-hypoglossal anastomosis through epineural suturing is the most effective technique with excellent outcomes for facial reanimation and preservation of tongue movement, particularly when performed as a primary technique.},

	abstract = {Sex is likely to play an important part in reanimation of the face after paralysis, with women being superior in terms of resistance to neural injury and regeneration. Our aim was to evaluate the influence of the sex of the patient on the recovery of facial paralysis after surgical reanimation by comparing the degree of restored movement between men and women with long-standing paralysis that was reanimated by transfer of the hypoglossal nerve or cross-face nerve grafting. Between 1999 and 2010 we operated on 174 patients with facial paralysis. Of these we studied 26 cases (19 women and 7 men) with complete long-standing paralysis reanimated with either cross-face nerve grafting (n=14) or transfer of the hemihypoglossal nerve (n=12). The degree of movement restored was recorded in each case. Statistical analysis showed that in cases with long-standing paralysis women had significantly more movement restored than men for both cross-face nerve grafting (p=0.02) and hypoglossal transposition (p=0.04). We conclude that, after a neural injury, women tend to maintain the viability of the facial musculature longer than men, which suggests that they are more resistant to both denervation and the development of muscular atrophy. Whether this phenomenon can be explained by neural or muscular processes, or both, warrants further studies.},

	abstract = {Background: This study describes a different approach with a 2-stage facial reanimation in patients with long-standing unilateral facial paralysis using free gracilis muscle transfer, innervated by both cross-facial nerve graft and masseteric nerve. The authors present their rationale, surgical technique, and long-term outcomes. Methods: Between August 2012 and March 2016, 11 patients (6 female and 5 male patients) underwent a 2-staged dually innervated gracilis muscle transfer. Patients were evaluated with physical examination and needle electromyography. A standardized assessment of preoperative and postoperative photographs and videos was performed using Terzis' smile functional grading system at 48 months following surgery and the Emotrics software to assess improvement in symmetry over a 36-month postoperative period. Results: Voluntary contraction of the gracilis muscle was observed in all patients at a mean of 4 months and 4 days following muscle transfer. A spontaneous smile produced without teeth clenching was developed in all patients by 18 months postoperatively. Six patients achieved excellent and 5 good results. The difference between the averaged pre- and postoperative scores was statistically significant. With Emotrics, there were significant improvements in the smile angle, upper lip elevation, commissural excursion, and commissural height, with continuous improvement over 36 months. The postoperative electromyography (EMG) confirmed dual innervation of the gracilis muscle by the facial and masseteric donor motor neural sources. We present our results at minimum 48 months postoperatively. Conclusions: Dual innervated two-stage gracilis transfer is an effective method for reanimation in long-standing unilateral facial paralysis, providing both rapid reinnervation of the transferred muscle, together with a powerful, synchronous smile.},

The high visibility of the region and the specialized structures involved create an interdependence between aesthetics and function. This article describes the authors' surgical concepts and experience in post-radical parotidectomy reconstruction. Methods: The various components of reconstruction following radical parotidectomy, including contour restoration, skin coverage, mandible reconstruction, and facial reanimation, are reviewed. The authors discuss their methods of choice and specific technical refinements. Twenty-one post-radical parotidectomy reconstruction patients (male:female, 17:4; median age, 75 years) treated from July of 2006 through May of 2010 were identified. Information on patient demographics, etiology, reconstruction technique, surgical complications, postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy, and survival was obtained. Results: The most common indication for radical parotidectomy was metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, followed by carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma and direct extension from primary cutaneous malignancy. The authors' standard approach in reconstruction was a combination of anterolateral thigh free flap and cervicofacial rotation advancement flap, repair of the facial nerve with the nerve to the vastus lateralis segmental interpositional graft, gold weight loading of the upper eyelid, lateral canthopexy, temporalis and digastric muscle transfers, and a delayed brow lift. Surgical complications include undercorrection of facial reanimation, gold weight extrusion, wound breakdown, and infections. Seventeen patients (81 percent) received adjuvant radiotherapy (range, 50 to 66 Gy to the primary site, 40 to 60 Gy to the neck). Conclusions: Radical parotidectomy is a morbid procedure that is sometimes necessary for oncologic control. With sound principles and attention to detail in reconstruction, however, quality of life can be greatly improved. Clinical question/level of evidence: Therapeutic, V.},

	abstract = {Background: Postparalysis facial synkinesis (PPFS) can occur after any cause of facial palsy. Current treatments are still inadequate. Surgical intervention, instead of Botox and rehabilitation only, for different degrees of PPFS was proposed. Methods: Seventy patients (43 females and 27 males) with PPFS were enrolled since 1986. They were divided into 4 patterns based on quality of smile and severity of synkinesis. Data collection for clinically various presentations was made: pattern I (n = 14) with good smile but synkinesis, pattern II (n = 17) with acceptable smile but dominant synkinesis, pattern III (n = 34) unacceptable smile and dominant synkinesis, and pattern IV (n = 5) poor smile and synkinesis. Surgical interventions were based on patterns of PPFS. Selective myectomy and some cosmetic procedures were performed for pattern I and II patients. Extensive myectomy and neurectomy of the involved muscles and nerves followed by functioning free-muscle transplantation for facial reanimation in 1- or 2-stage procedure were performed for pattern III and many pattern II patients. A classic 2-stage procedure for facial reanimation was performed for pattern IV patients. Results: Minor aesthetic procedures provided some help to pattern I patients but did not cure the problem. They all had short follow-up. Most patients in patterns II (14/17, 82\%) and III (34/34, 100\%) showed a significant improvement of eye and smile appearance and significant decrease in synkinetic movements following the aggressively major surgical intervention. Nearly, all of the patients treated by the authors did not need repeated botulinum toxin A injection nor require a profound rehabilitation program in the follow-up period. Conclusions: Treatment of PPFS remains a challenging problem. Major surgical reconstruction showed more promising and long-lasting results than botulinum toxin A and/or rehabilitation on pattern III and II patients.},

Objective: To measure the available excursion of the temporalis MTU after release from the coronoid. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Thirteen consecutive patients undergoing the temporalis MTU transfer procedure for facial reanimation participated in this study in an academic research setting. Main outcomes and measures: Using transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the temporalis muscle, excursion of the temporalis muscle after its release as an MTU was recorded. Tension was varied on the released tendon during electrical stimulation of the muscle to determine the optimal muscle length at which the maximum excursion could be achieved. The tendon was inserted at the modiolus at the determined muscle length, and excursion of the oral commissure was recorded. Excursion data were then measured from the video recordings. RESULTS The mean excursion of the temporalis tendon after its detachment from the mandible and stimulation at an optimized passive tension was 20.6 mm (range, 14-30 mm) (n = 9). Following tendon insertion, the mean oral commissure excursion was 15.5 mm (range, 8-23 mm) (n = 13). Conclusions and relevance: The temporalis MTU has adequate available excursion following mobilization for dynamic reanimation of the paralyzed face. Electrical stimulation of the released temporalis tendon gives useful information that is reproducible and can be an important intraoperative adjunct to setting the MTU at an optimal tension to maximize force generation and excursion.

Our study population was made up of 221 patients-131 females and 90 males, aged 14 to 79 years (mean: 49.7)-who had been referred to the Facial Nerve Disorders Clinic at our tertiary care academic medical center over a 23-year period with a documented neoplastic cause of facial paralysis. In addition to demographic data, we compiled information on clinical signs and symptoms, radiologic and pathologic findings, and surgical approaches. All patients exhibited gradual-onset facial weakness or facial twitching. Imaging identified an extratemporal tumor in 128 patients (58\%), an intratemporal lesion in 55 patients (25\%), and an intradural mass in 38 (17\%). Almost all of the extratemporal tumors (99\%) were malignant, while 91\% of the intratemporal and intradural tumors were benign. A transtemporal surgical approach was used in the 93 intratemporal and intradural tumor resections, while the 128 extratemporal lesions required a parotidectomy with partial temporal bone dissection. The vast majority of patients (97\%) underwent facial reanimation. We conclude that gradual-onset facial paralysis or twitching may occur as a result of a neoplastic invasion of the facial nerve along its course from the cerebellopontine angle to the parotid gland. We caution readers to beware of a diagnosis of "atypical Bell's palsy."},

In the present study, the outcome of surgical management in 18 patients with FNS was analyzed and an appropriate time for surgery was proposed. Materials and methods: A total of 18 patients with FNS who underwent surgical management by a single surgeon from 1999 to 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Among the 18 patients, five had no facial paralysis before surgery. Near-total removal was performed in three cases, and two cases were managed with decompression. In 13 cases with various degree of preoperative facial palsy, nerve continuity was lost during surgery. FN was reconstructed using cable graft in ten cases, direct anastomosis in one case, and facial-hypoglossal nerve transfer in one case. Facial reanimation surgery without FN reconstruction was performed in one case due to a long-standing facial paralysis before surgery. Preoperative House-Brackmann (H-B) grade in all patients was significantly worse as tumor size increased. The correlation was not observed between the duration and severity of preoperative facial palsy. Analysis of 12 patients who underwent FN reconstruction revealed that all patients with good preoperative facial function (H-B grade II-III) recovered to H-B grade III after surgery (7/7, 100\%). However, patients with poor preoperative facial function (H-B grade IV or worse) had only a 40\% (2/5) chance of improving to grade III after surgery. Preoperative tumor size and duration of facial palsy did not affect postoperative final facial function. Conclusion: We suggest that H-B grade III facial palsy is the best time for surgical intervention, regardless of the tumor size or duration of facial palsy.},

	title = {Facial reanimation by staged, split masseter muscle transfer},
	abstract = {Background: Facial paralysis of the lower face presents severe functional and aesthetic disturbance to patients. The gamut of facial paralysis correction is diverse and must be tailored to the patient. When nerve repair or free functional muscle transfer is unavailable, regional muscle transfer has become a staple in surgical management of facial paralysis. Previous masseter transfers relied on orbicularis oris attachment, which may be atrophic, adhered, or lengthened. Using fascia lata grafts, we describe the senior author's method of staged, split masseter transfer as a reliable method for reanimating the lower third of the face in appropriate candidates. Methods: The staged, split masseter muscle transfer is a 3-part repair. The first stage places a hemioral fascia lata graft to act as an anchor reinforcement. The second stage transfers the split masseter muscle, suturing to the fascia lata reinforced oral commissure. The third stage, a reefing procedure, is performed 6 to 10 months later under local anesthesia to reinforce attachments. Results: Six patients underwent the staged, split masseter muscle transfer. Mean age was 43 (15-67) years. Mean time to surgery from onset of deficit was 174 months (3 months to 65 years). All patients had significant improvement over preoperative symptoms. Symmetry was restored in repose. On movement, commissure excursion went from 0 to 6.67 mm in the superolateral vector. Of the 6 patients, 5 required an average of 1.5 outpatient revisions to achieve satisfactory results on average of 4.67 (4-127) months after the final stage. Conclusions: The staged, split masseter transfer is useful for restoring subtle reanimation in patients presenting with facial paralysis. The staged, split masseter transfer provides bulk and restores both static and dynamic function. We present a case series demonstrating excellent long-term functional results.},

Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review with 18 consecutive patients who underwent gracilis muscle flap transfer with or without the use of a GIA stapler. Results: Of 11 operations with the GIA stapler, one patient developed a hematoma (donor site) and another required drainage of an abscess (recipient site). Of 8 operations without the use of the stapler, one patient had total flap failure and three required drainage of an abscess (2 recipient sites and 1 donor site). These differences trended toward improvement but were not statistically different. Conclusions: The use of the GIA stapler is a fast, safe technique. Larger studies are, however, warranted to further examine this novel approach in order to test precisely what factors of increased efficiency occur, the amount of suture pull-through, and overall tension capable of being applied to the secured staple line.},

Visual acuity improved in 92 per cent of patients. There were two extrusions amongst the early cases. Conclusion and significance: Customized gold eyelid implantation offers an alternative in regions where commercial implants are not easily obtained.},

	abstract = {Importance: Assessing facial function using high-quality photographs would improve long-term and objective outcomes tracking in facial palsy, facilitate automated facial grading using artificial intelligence algorithms, and allow for remote follow up. Objective: To determine agreement between in-person and photographic electronic facial function scale (eFACE) assessments, and evaluate inter-rater reliability of photographic eFACE evaluation. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective review of eFACE scores from in-person interviews and standardized photographs using the Massachusetts Eye and Ear (MEE) Standard Facial Palsy Dataset. Main Outcomes and Measures: eFACE total scores and subset scores determined by two experienced facial reanimation surgeons in person and from photographs. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients for eFACE scores were 0.96 (95\% CI 0.94 to 0.97) for total scores, 0.99 (95\% CI 0.989 to 0.995) for static scores, 0.82 (95\% CI 0.74 to 0.88) for dynamic scores, and 0.98 (95\% CI 0.97 to 0.99) for synkinesis scores. Photographic and in-person scores had a mean difference of -0.64 (95\% CI -2.05 to 0.77; p = 0.37) for total score, -1.58 (95\% CI -4.22 to 1.05; p = 0.24) for the static subset, 0.14 (95\% CI -1.70 to 1.97; p = 0.88) for the dynamic subset, and -1.11 (95\% CI -3.09 to 0.86; p = 0.26) for the synkinetic subset. Bland-Altman analysis showed no trend for increasing differences in total score or subset scores. Conclusions: eFACE assessment obtained via photographs exhibits excellent inter-rater reliability and strong agreement with in-person assessment, demonstrating facial symmetry in facial palsy patients can be monitored using standardized frontal photographs.},

	abstract = {Background: Functioning free muscle transplantation is currently the gold standard for the reconstruction of facial paralysis, focusing more on the upper lip reconstruction rather than on the lower lip. This study aimed to compare different lower lip reconstructive methods when performing functioning free muscle transplantation for facial reanimation. Methods: A retrospective review of functioning free muscle transplantation for facial reanimation from 2007 to 2015 was performed. Patients were divided into three groups: in group 1 (n = 15), a free plantaris tendon graft anchored to the gracilis muscle was passed into the lower lip to create a loop within; in group 2 (n = 12), an aponeurosis tail of the gracilis muscle was attached to the lower lip; and in group 3 (n = 18), no suspension of the lower lip was performed. All patients had at least 2 years of follow-up. Outcomes were assessed by photographs and videos, including subjective evaluation of midline deviation and horizontal tilt and objective analysis of smile dimensions and area. Results: A total of 45 patients were included. Results from the subjective evaluation demonstrate group 1 patients having the best improvement (overall score: p = 0.004 and p = 0.005, Fisher's exact test). The objective evaluation showed group 1 and 2 patients with better results compared with group 3 (horizontal component, p = 0.009; vertical component, p = 0.004; area distribution, p {\textless} 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). Conclusions: Both plantaris tendon graft and gracilis aponeurosis achieved better improvement in subjective and objective evaluations than those who had no reconstruction of the lower lip. In particular, the plantaris tendon graft can achieve the most lower lip excursion with overall improved symmetry. Clinical question/level of evidence: Therapeutic, III.},

	abstract = {Background: Patients with facial nerve palsy can have many ocular complications. Lagophthalmos, or poor eyelid closure, and loss of blink secondary to lack of nerve supply to the orbicularis oculi, can lead to exposure keratopathy, corneal breakdown, ulcers, and even perforation. Management of patients should be directed toward the severity of ocular findings and ranges from supportive care to surgical reanimation and soft tissue repositioning. Patients with facial nerve palsy who present at earlier stages can benefit from conservative treatment. Use of temporary external eyelid weights can help restore a functional blink mechanism and prevent corneal decompensation. Case report: A 29-year-old patient with lagophthalmos secondary to left facial nerve palsy after surgical excision of an acoustic neuroma was treated with a temporary external eyelid weight. Conclusion: Temporary external eyelid weights are part of the armamentarium in the supportive care of patients with lagophthalmos and exposure keratopathy secondary to facial nerve palsy. They are most useful in patients who have temporary paralysis or as a bridge until further surgery can be performed.},

	abstract = {Facial paralysis is a severe pathological condition, negatively affecting patients' quality of life. The altered tone and mobility of the mimetic musculature provoke both functional and morphological deficits. In the present study, we longitudinally measured facial movements in 14 patients (21-69 years) affected by unilateral facial paralysis not lasting longer than 23 months. The patients were analyzed before and after surgical masseteric to facial nerve neurorrhaphy. Examinations were performed at least 3 months after they had clinically started to regain facial mimicry. The displacement of selected facial landmarks was measured using an optoelectronic three-dimensional motion analyzer during: maximum smile without clenching (pre- and postsurgery), maximum smile by clenching on their posterior teeth (only postsurgery), and spontaneous smile (recorded during the vision of a funny video in both examinations). Before facial surgery, in all smiles facial landmarks moved more in the healthy than in the paretic side; after surgery, the differences decreased for both reduction of the healthy-side motion, and increment of the paretic-side motion (motion ratio before 52\%, after 87\%, p {\textless} 0.05, Students' t-test). The ratio between the paretic and healthy-side total motion (asymmetry) did not modify for maximum and spontaneous smiles, but significantly increased for the maximum smiles made with teeth clenching (asymmetry before 32\%, after 11\%, p {\textless} 0.001). Spontaneous smiles were recorded only in a subset of patients, but their execution was modified by surgery, with more symmetrical movements of the rehabilitated-side landmarks (asymmetry before 33\%, after 10\%), and reduced motion of the healthy-side ones (motion ratio before 51\%, after 83\%). In conclusion, the significant asymmetry in the magnitude of facial movements that characterized the analyzed patients before surgery reduced after surgery, at least in those facial areas interested by the masseteric to facial nerve reanimation.},

Eleven patients (age range 42-76 years) with unilateral facial palsy, treated by triple innervation procedure (masseteric and partial hypoglossal reinnervation, plus double cross-face facial grafting), performed five facial animations: rest position, smiling by contracting the healthy side, clenching the teeth, and pushing the tongue against the lower incisors and Mona Lisa smiling. These were recorded by stereophotogrammetry. Sixty healthy subjects were also recorded. The 3D reconstruction of each facial expression was registered onto the rest position scan, and the root mean square (RMS) point-to-point distance between the two 3D surfaces was calculated automatically for the facial thirds. RMS values on the rehabilitated hemiface were 74.8\% (upper third), 46.6\% (middle third), and 54.1\% (lower third) of those recorded in healthy subjects. RMS values were higher in the middle and lower thirds than in the upper third, and during smile provided by masseteric stimulus (P{\textless}0.05). The rehabilitated hemiface differed more from healthy subject values than the healthy hemiface did (P{\textless}0.05). On average, patients were more asymmetric than healthy subjects (P=0.004). The proposed method is non-invasive and non-contact, and it can quantify localized facial movements after surgical procedures.},

	abstract = {Hypoglossal-facial crossover is the most popular method of reconstructing the facial nerve in facial palsy resulting from proximal facial-nerve injury near the brainstem. Conventional hypoglossal-facial crossover involves performing a partial hypoglossal-nerve section or incision and an interpositional nerve graft to bridge the gap between the two nerves, which sometimes results in hemiglossal atrophy and its sequelae. Furthermore, the nerve graft may delay recovery and make facial reanimation weak. To solve these problems, we attempted to perform 'pure end-to-side anastomosis' (without section of the hypoglossal nerve) between the hypoglossal and facial nerves in four patients with facial palsy. In two patients (group I) a sural-nerve graft was used to bridge the gap between the two nerves. In the other two patients (group II) the intratemporal facial nerve was mobilised to the neck and one tension-free end-to-side anastomosis was performed. Facial symmetry and tone at rest were restored in all cases. Facial reanimation was achieved in group II after 8 months. Despite the small number of cases, we believe that the technique of hypoglossal-facial crossover with 'pure end-to-side anastomosis' and mobilisation of the intratemporal facial nerve can decrease donor-nerve morbidity in facial-nerve rehabilitation.},

The aim of this study was to assess the utility of our procedure of double innervation of free gracilis muscle for reconstruction of long-standing facial palsy. Patients and methods: In our department, 6 cases of long-standing facial paralysis (4 cases of complete palsy and 2 of incomplete palsy) were reconstructed using a free gracilis muscle double innervated with the masseteric and contralateral facial nerves. The patient age ranged from 37 to 79 years (average 56.7 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 15.7). In our procedure, the intramuscular motor branch of the transferred muscle was identified and sutured to the ipsilateral masseteric nerve in an end-to-end fashion, and the obturator nerve of the transferred muscle was sutured to the cross-facial nerve graft, which was coapted with the contralateral facial nerve by end-to-end suturing. Results: All patients were followed up for {\textgreater}18 months and recovered their smiling function. The voluntary movement of the transferred muscle with teeth clenching was observed at approximately 4.7 months, and this movement combined with contralateral mouth angle elevation was observed at approximately 9.5 months after the surgery. Conclusions: Our experience suggests that the distal stump of the intramuscular motor branch of the obturator nerve may be useful for facial reanimation via double-powered free gracilis muscle flap transfer.},

In our study the authors performed facial reanimation in long standing cases of facial palsy (more than 1 year), gracilis muscle was used as a free functioning muscle transfer. Two motor donor nerves were used: cross-face nerve graft and masseter nerve. Materials and methods: A total of 205 cases of unilateral facial reanimation with free functional muscle transfer (FFMT) were performed between 1998 and 2019. Out of 205 patients, 184 patients were operated by cross facial nerve graft-gracilis, and 21 by masseter nerve-gracilis. Quantitative assessment for outcome was done by measuring the excursion on follow up. Oral competence outcome and satisfaction score calculation was done by questionnaire. Results of spontaneous smile were divided into positive and negative groups. Results: A 2 stage cross facial nerve graft-gracilis FFMT achieved most natural and spontaneous smile when longer observation period (‚Äö√¢‚Ä¢2 years) was followed. Masseter nerve-gracilis provided satisfactory results in the shortest rehabilitation period, had more excursion but never obtained spontaneous smile. Conclusions: The cross facial nerve graft-gracilis FFMT can achieve natural and spontaneous smile and remains our first choice for facial reanimation. Masseter nerve-gracilis can be used if cross facial nerve graft-gracilis fails, patient desires a single stage surgery and in some specific conditions, such as bilateral mobius syndrome.},

	title = {Outcomes of mini-hypoglossal nerve transfer and direct muscle neurotization for restoration of lower lip function in facial palsy},
	abstract = {Background: Most reconstructions for lower lip palsy focus on paralyzing the contralateral normal lip or providing static support on the affected side. The authors' unit has reported dynamic strategies for lower lip reanimation and use of 40 percent of the hypoglossal nerve (mini-hypoglossal) in facial reanimation. They report their experience with mini-hypoglossal nerve transfer for lower lip palsy. Methods: Between 1987 and 2005, 29 patients with unilateral facial palsy had lower lip reanimation with the mini-hypoglossal as the motor donor. Twenty patients had transfer of the mini-hypoglossal to the cervicofacial branch of the facial nerve and nine had direct depressor muscle neurotization. Five patients had a mean denervation time of 14.60 +/- 4.50 months ({\textless}2 years), and the rest had a mean denervation time of 10.63 +/- 9.23 years. In late cases, the facial nerve was in-continuity, and preoperative needle electromyographs of depressors showed at least fibrillations. Standardized videos taken preoperatively and at 2 years postoperatively were available for 27 patients and assessed by three independent reviewers. Needle electromyographic results were analyzed. Results: Thirteen patients (48.15 percent) achieved excellent and good results, nine (33.33 percent) had moderate results, and five (18.52 percent) obtained fair results. The difference between the averaged preoperative and postoperative scores was statistically significant, as was the difference in electromyographic outcomes (p {\textless} 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed rank test). The nerve transfer and direct neurotization groups had no statistically significant difference in clinical and electromyographic outcomes. Four patients required muscle transfer for further outcome upgrading. Conclusion: Use of the mini-hypoglossal either for nerve transfer or for direct muscle neurotization of lower lip depressors can provide reinnervation and satisfactory clinical function, even for muscles with prolonged partial denervation.},

Our objective herein was to describe a novel method of static miDFace suspension that produces improved functional and aesthetic outcomes compared to previous techniques. Specifically, our goal was to describe the technique of alar and oral commissure repositioning via modiolar rotational cheiloplasty with alar base transposition, and gingivobuccal sulcoplasty. Study design: Retrospective case series. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the results of a series of adult patients desiring surgical intervention for paralysis of the central oval of the face at a tertiary care referral center. We present our technique of modiolar rotational cheiloplasty first with an example case, including subjective outcomes reported by the patient and objective improvements in facial appearance using Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Facial Assessment by Computer Evaluation Program (MEEI FACE-Gram) software, then demonstrate long-term outcomes from the series. Results: Clinically, patients noted subjective improvement in drooling, buccal stasis of food, dysarthria, nasal obstruction, and overall appearance. Patients with significant atrophy and lateral displacement of the lower lip underwent concomitant wedge resection, which further improved the symmetry and position of the lips. The MEEI FACE-Gram software demonstrated objective improvement in symmetry of smile and position of the philtrum and nasal base in an example case. Conclusions: Modiolar rotational cheiloplasty with alar base transposition is an effective and efficient static procedure for miDFace palsy that improves both function and appearance.

Software analysis of digital video data is used to measure facial movements, comparing the affected to the normal side. We present the first use of the Glasgow Facial Palsy Scale following facial re-animation surgery. Design: A comparison of the Glasgow Facial Palsy Scale against the Nottingham scoring system. Subjects undergoing unilateral surgical smile reanimation procedures were selected. Comparison was made with the Nottingham facial palsy scale and the House-Brackmann Scale pre- and postoperatively. Setting: Patients were recruited in the facial palsy clinic of Canniesburn Plastic Surgery Unit, Glasgow. Participants: Seven consecutive patients were selected who were due to undergo unilateral facial reanimation. Main outcome measures: The difference in pre- and post-surgical facial movement as measured using the Glasgow Facial Palsy Scale with this value being compared to that obtained using the Nottingham scoring system. Note was also taken of the correlation with House-Brackmann system and clinical correlation. Results and conclusions: Statistical analysis indicated a linear relationship between the Glasgow Facial Palsy Scale and the Nottingham System. The Pearson correlation test was used to confirm the relationship between the two methods giving a result of -0.587, which indicates significant correlation between the two methods. We conclude that the Glasgow Facial Palsy Scale is a standardised objective method of assessing the change in facial movement following smile reanimation surgery. We commend it as a useful tool to objectively assess surgical results in this challenging field.},

Each patient performed three facial animations: brow raise; free smile; lip purse. These were recorded using an optoelectronic motion analyser. The three-dimensional coordinates of facial landmarks were obtained, their movements were computed, and asymmetry indices calculated (differential movements between the two hemi-faces: healthy and paretic/rehabilitated). Before surgery, mobility was larger in the healthy than in the paretic side; after surgery, the differences were reduced (brow raise and lip purse), or even reversed (smile). Before surgery, lip purse was performed with significant labial asymmetry (p=0.042; larger healthy side movement). After surgery, asymmetry indices reduced. Total labial asymmetry during smiling was significantly different from 0 before surgery (p=0.018, larger healthy side movement). After surgery, all asymmetry indices became non-significant. Before surgery the lateral displacements of all labial landmarks were towards the healthy side, while they normalized after surgery.},

A variety of face-lift and reanimation techniques have been utilized in the past, but with time, these frequently require further surgery. We describe the use of Mitek (Norwood, MA) suture anchors for cheek resuspension in a patient with facial palsy. This system is composed of a drill guide, drill, inserter, and anchor. Although the titanium alloy anchors come in multiple sizes, the Mini GII Anchor is typically most appropriate for use in facial procedures. The actual size of the Mini GII Anchor is 1.8 mm in diameter and 5.4 mm in length. Two small arched prongs extend from the body of the anchor, and an eyelet at the superior surface is used for suture placement. When placed into a pre-drilled hole with the insertion tool, the prongs extend, effectively fixing the anchor in place. The drill guide protects adjacent soft tissues during the drilling process and allows drilling to a predetermined fixed depth. Sutures attached to the anchor may then be used for soft tissue fixation to bone.},

The authors report 3 cases of 1-stage reconstruction by transferring neurovascular chimeric latissimus dorsi (LD) musculo-adipose flaps, with satisfactory results. Methods: Three patients with depression deformity and DMs dysfunction after tumor resection in the perimandibular region underwent chimeric LD flap transfer. The flap comprised 1 portion with adipose tissue for augmentation, and the other contained muscle bellies with 1 or 2 neural pedicle (s) for DM reanimation. In case 1, the neural pedicle was sutured to the contralateral marginal mandibular branch. In case 2, the neural pedicle was sutured to the ipsilateral marginal mandibular branch. In case 3, the neural pedicle was sutured to both branches of the facial nerve. Results: All patients were satisfied with the deformity corrections. However, contractions of the transferred muscles varied. Case 1 showed insufficient contraction. Case 2 had excessive muscle contraction. In case 3, the muscle had double innervation, and well-balanced contraction was maintained for 3 years. Conclusions: Neurovascular chimeric LD flaps are versatile and useful for secondary reconstruction after tumor resection for functional loss of mimetic muscles. The ipsilateral facial nerve may be an effective motor source.},

Using MetaMorph software, the number of motor axons was calculated, with the exception of the nerve specimens at the distal nerve grafts in stage II, which were quantitated manually. Mann-Whitney and Fisher's exact tests were used to test the effects of axon numbers and other factors on the outcomes. Results: The donor axonal input correlated with the axon number at the distal end of the nerve graft and also correlated with the improvement of evaluation; however, no significance was found between the counts at the distal end of the nerve graft and the clinical outcomes. An important observation was that patients with a donor nerve count of 900 or higher showed a greater likelihood of achieving satisfactory results. Conclusion: The axon count at the donor nerve has a stronger influence on the final results.},

	abstract = {Background: Multistage reconstructive procedures are often required to try to restore the emotional potential of human expression in cases of facial paralysis. In this study, the senior author's (J.K.T.) experience with the technique of direct nerve to muscle neurotization as a part of multistage facial reanimation procedures is presented. Age, denervation time, etiology of the lesion, previous reconstructive procedures, and types of muscles responsible for animation were analyzed to make evidence-based recommendations on the indications of the technique as well as its role and effectiveness in facial reanimation. Methods: Retrospective review of 37 pediatric patients who underwent direct muscle neurotization took place. The patients were divided into three groups, depending on the region that direct neurotization was aiming to augment. Group A involved 28 patients for eye closure and blink, group B included 15 patients for smile, and group C included 19 patients for depressor augmentation. Results: Twenty patients were female and 17 male. Patient age ranged from 1 to 16 years, with a mean age (+/-SD) of 9 +/- 2.8 years. Denervation time ranged from 3 months to 15.25 years, and the mean denervation time was 6.72 years. Electromyographic scoring of the neurotized muscles showed an overall mean improvement of 36 percent for eye closure, 34.25 percent for blink, 37 percent for smile augmentation, and 30 percent for depressor function restoration. Conclusion: Direct muscle neurotization has a valid role in pediatric facial reanimation procedures, as it augments and promotes expressivity.},

Methods: A single-center retrospective cohort study was performed. Forty-one adults (46\% women; median age: 55 years) received a hypoglossal-facial jump nerve suture. Sunnybrook and eFACE grading was performed before surgery and at a median time of 42 months after surgery. The Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE) survey and the Facial Disability Index (FDI) were used to quantify face-specific quality of life after surgery. Results: Hypoglossal-facial jump nerve suture was successful in all cases without tongue dysfunction. After surgery, the median FaCE Total score was 60 and the median FDI Total score was 76.3. Most Sunnybrook and eFACE grading subscores improved significantly after surgery. Younger age was the only consistent independent predictor for better FaCE outcome. Additional upper eyelid weight loading further improved the FaCE Eye comfort subscore. Sunnybrook grading showed a better correlation to FaCE assessment than the eFACE. Neither Sunnybrook nor eFACE grading correlated to the FDI assessment.

Objective: To evaluate the use of the pattern of facial paralysis recovery in the early postoperative months as a sole predictor in selecting patients for facial nerve grafting after CPA tumor resection when cranial nerve VII is uninterrupted. Design, setting, and participants: Sixty-two patients with facial paralysis and uninterrupted cranial nerve VII who developed facial paralysis after CPA tumor resection at The Johns Hopkins Hospital were followed up prospectively to assess for spontaneous recovery and to determine candidacy for facial reanimation surgery. The study dates and dates of analysis were January 1, 2009, to March 31, 2015. Interventions: After a minimum of 6 months of clinical follow-up and no signs of clinical recovery, patients underwent facial nerve exploration and a masseteric or hypoglossal nerve transfer. Intraoperative direct nerve stimulation was performed to assess for the presence of subclinical reinnervation. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 18 months after surgery to evaluate outcomes. Main outcomes and measures: Facial function and recovery were studied objectively with a Smile Recovery Scale, Facial Asymmetry Index, and House-Brackmann (HB) grading system. Other outcome measures included the duration of paralysis, time to recovery, and evidence of synkinesis. Results: Sixty-two patients (33 men, 29 women; mean age 51.8 years) with uninterrupted facial nerves after CPA tumor resection developed HB grade IV, V, or VI facial paralysis. Ten patients underwent nerve grafting by 12 months, 9 patients received grafting after 12 months, and 8 patients had no intervention. Thirty-five patients spontaneously recovered. In all patients who underwent nerve grafting, there were no detectable facial muscle movements or electromyographic response to direct facial nerve stimulation suggestive of occult reinnervation. Overall, early facial reanimation surgery resulted in a shorter total duration of paralysis. Masseteric nerve grafting resulted in earlier recovery compared with hypoglossal nerve grafting (5.6 vs 10.8 months, P = .005). Patients who showed no signs of recovery by 6 months after CPA surgery but declined facial reanimation surgery demonstrated at best HB grade V recovery after 18 months of observation. Conclusions and relevance: The recovery pattern in the early postoperative period among patients who develop facial paralysis after CPA tumor resection is a useful clinical tool in selecting patients for facial reanimation surgery. Patients can be counseled for facial reanimation surgery as early as 6 months after surgery because satisfactory facial functional recovery is unlikely to occur when there is no clinical evidence of spontaneous nerve regeneration in the first 6 months.

	abstract = {Objective: Although the rate of reported facial nerve preservation after surgery for vestibular schwannomas continuously increases, facial nerve paresis or paralysis is a frequent postsurgical sequelae of major concern. The major goal of this study was to define criteria for the right indication, timing, and type of therapy for patients with palsies despite anatomic nerve continuity and those with loss of anatomic continuity. Methods: One thousand vestibular schwannomas were surgically treated at the Department of Neurosurgery at Nordstadt Hospital from 1978 to 1993. Of 979 cases of complete removal and 21 cases of deliberately partial removal, the facial nerve was anatomically preserved in 929 cases (93\%). The rate of preservation is increasing, as is evidenced in the most recent cases, and preservation is supported by special electrophysiological monitoring. The facial nerve was anatomically severed in 60 cases (6\%). It was anatomically lost in previous operations that were performed elsewhere in 11 cases (1\%). In case of nerve discontinuity (42 cases), immediate nerve reconstruction by one of three available intracranial procedures (within the cerebellopontine angle, intracranial-intratemporal, intracranial-extracranial) was performed in the same surgical setting. In case of loss of the proximal facial nerve stump at the brain stem, early reanimation by combination with the hypoglossal nerve was achieved in most patients within weeks after tumor surgery. In a few patients with anatomic nerve continuity but absence of reinnervation for 10 to 12 months, a hypoglossal-facial combination was applied. All the patients with partial or with complete palsies were treated in a special follow-up program of regular controls and of modulation of physiotherapeutic treatment every 3 to 6 months. Results: In intracranial nerve reconstruction at the cerebellopontine angle, 61 to 70\% of patients regained complete eye closure and an overall result equivalent to House-Brackmann Grade 3. Hypoglossal-facial reanimation led to Grade 3 in 79\%. The duration between the onset of paralysis and the reconstructive procedure is decisive for the quality of the outcome. These data are discussed in view of other treatment options and certain parameters influencing outcome. Conclusions: This management contains three major principles as follows: 1) preservation of facial nerve continuity in function by the aid of intraoperative monitoring, 2) early nerve reconstruction in case of lost continuity, and 3) scheduled follow-up program for all patients with incomplete or complete palsies.},

	abstract = {Paralysis of the frontalis muscle is extremely difficult to reverse. The best treatment for facial paralysis reanimation which preserves spontaneity and muscle specificity is end-to-end neurorrhaphy through cross-face nerve grafting. However, it is rarely possible. Muscle-nerve-muscle (MNM) neurotization consists of an interposition of a nerve graft connecting the normal muscle to the denervated muscle. The axons of the muscle with intact innervation grow inside a neural graft towards the paralyzed muscle resulting in neurotization. The purpose of this report is to present a case of frontalis muscle paralysis reanimated by MNM neurotization. A 65-year-old female patient presented complete facial paralysis after temporomandibular joint surgery. Five months afterwards, the patient spontaneously recovered facial muscle movements except the frontalis muscle. Definitive paralysis of the frontalis muscle was diagnosed after 11 months, and MNM neurotization was chosen and performed. Three strings of sural nerve were placed in separated tunnels in the subcutaneous plane, through small skin incisions to connect the two bellies of frontalis muscle bilaterally, and then sutured into the muscle pocket of each side. The patient presented voluntary and synchronic contraction of the bilateral frontalis muscle, 4 months after neurotization. Electroneuromyography confirmed muscle contraction by contralateral stimulation. Despite its efficacy still being researched, it is a very promising technique for the reanimation of small muscles in facial paralysis.},

At 28 months after surgery, he showed temporal and buccal depression and incomplete facial paralysis. We planned 1-stage reconstruction using a neurovascular LD chimeric flap, which was divided into dual compounds of the neurovascular muscle with soft tissue along the descending and transverse bifurcation of the thoracodorsal neurovascular bundle. We added adipose tissue to the muscle belly of the transverse branch using microperforators. We cut the transverse nerve 2.7 cm from the hilus and about 5 cm from the bifurcation, enabling the proximal stump of the transverse branch to be sutured to the ipsilateral buccal branch and function as a cross-face nerve graft. The transverse branch compound was placed on the temporal region and its neural pedicle was sutured to the zygomatic branch. The descending branch compound was placed in the buccal region and sutured to the contralateral buccal branch.At 58 months after surgery, good contour remained, and smiling was voluntary and natural. On needle electromyography, the zygomatic major muscle and the muscle transferred to the buccal region showed good contraction, and the muscle transferred to the temporal region provided tonus to the lower eyelid. The versatility of the neurovascular chimeric flap facilitated multiple augmentations and 3 reanimations.},

	title = {Modified retrograde approach to upper eyelid static loading},
	abstract = {Objectives/hypothesis: Upper eyelid static weight loading is a technique commonly used to treat paralytic lagophthalmos. The traditional approach using the pretarsal crease incision leads to interruption of the anterior levator muscle fibers that attach to the face of the tarsus at its upper two thirds. This disruption can lead to permanent upper eyelid blepharoptosis. The retrograde approach avoids this problem but results in an incision at the lid margin, the dependent aspect of the weight. This increases the risk of implant extrusion. We hypothesize that a newly described modified retrograde approach is a safe and effective approach that avoids the pitfalls of previously described techniques. Study design: Retrospective review. Methods: Eight patients were evaluated with preoperative and 3 to 6 month postoperative photographs with the eyes in the open and closed positions for the degree of lagophthalmos and blepharoptosis present. Patients were also evaluated for development of complications such as implant extrusion, pain, or infection. The surgical technique uses a supratarsal skin crease incision, supramuscular dissection to the lid margin, entry into the tarsal plane at its inferior-most aspect, creation of a pocket for implant insertion, and layered closure. Results: All patients had complete correction of lagophthalmos. No patients experienced infection, extrusion, or eye pain after surgery. All patients had less than 2-mm ptosis after surgery, with no patients experiencing any visual field disruption. Conclusions: The modified retrograde approach to upper eyelid static loading for paralytic lagophthalmos provides advantages over other techniques described. It is a safe, efficacious procedure, well tolerated by patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Reinnervation of the facial musculature when there is loss of the proximal facial nerve poses a difficult clinical problem. Restoration of spontaneous mimetic motion is the aim and, to this end, the use of cross-facial nerve grafts has long been considered the reconstruction of choice. The nerve to masseter has been used very successfully for reinnervation of microvascular functioning muscle transfers for facial reanimation in established facial palsy but its use as a direct nerve transfer to the facial nerve to reinnervate 'viable' facial musculature has been scarce. Methods: Electron micrographic studies of axonal counts in the nerve to masseter and nerve to gracilis in a clinical series of seven patients undergoing surgery for facial nerve palsy were made. Based on these results, and previous success with the use of the nerve to masseter for reinnervation of free gracilis transfers, we report our experience with the transfer of the nerve to masseter for direct coaptation with the ipsilateral facial nerve to restore facial motion. Results: Our axonal counts of the nerve to masseter have, on average, 1542+/-291.70 (SD) axons. Historical data have shown that the buccal branch of the facial nerve has 834+/-285 (SD) where the distal end of a cross-facial nerve graft has 100 to 200 axons. Our clinical use of the nerve to masseter as a direct nerve transfer in three patients based on these data has resulted in significant improvement in facial symmetry in repose (at a minimum of 1 year follow up), restoration of facial motion with occasional spontaneous activity and minimal synkinesis without any donor morbidity. Conclusions: The advantages of this technique include the ease of dissection, constant and reliable anatomy, powerful reinnervation of the facial muscles without donor site morbidity and the potential for return of spontaneous facial movement.},

OBJECTIVE To report objective excursion and symmetry outcomes from a series of free gracilis cases and investigate the predictive value of intraoperative measurements on final outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective medical chart review was undertaken of all patients who underwent microvascular free gracilis transfer for smile at our institution over the past 10 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcome measures included the following: smile excursion, angle of smile with respect to the vertical midline, and facial symmetry during repose and with smile. Measurements were obtained using an automated tool for assessment of facial landmarks (FACE-Gram). An exhaustive set of intraoperative parameters including degree of recoil of the gracilis muscle following harvest, the degree to which the muscle foreshortened during stimulation of the obturator nerve, final stretched length of the inset muscle, surgeon assessment of neurorrhaphy and pulse pressure, ischemia time, number of sutures used during neurorrhaphy, nerve used to innervate the flap, and surgeon assessment of oral commissure overcorrection were recorded and placed into a linear regression model to investigate correlations with smile. RESULTS From March 2003 to March 2013, 154 microvascular free gracilis transfers were performed for facial reanimation at our institution, 14 (9\%) of which were deemed failures. Of the remaining 140 flaps, 127 fulfilled inclusion criteria and constituted the study cohort. Smile excursion, angle excursion, and symmetry of the oral commissure at repose and with smile all improved following gracilis free flap (P {\textless} .05). Associations between selected outcomes measures and intraoperative gracilis measurements were identified.

There was a significant increase in the distance of oral commissure excursion at rest and when smiling. A statistically significant increase was observed in symmetry when smiling. Terzis' functional and aesthetic grading scores showed significant improvements postoperatively. Conclusions: Masseter nerve innervation is a good option with many uses in in established facial palsy patients. For some conditions, it is the first-line treatment. Free gracilis muscle transfer using the masseter nerve has excellent. Results: with good symmetry and an effective degree of recovery.},

	abstract = {The percentage of facial palsy in the otomandibular dysostosis is great. It varies from 12 to 50\% in the literature. The OMENS classification embodies the muscular and facial nerve defects, and appears to represent the most inclusive classification. Few literature reviews have proposed a treatment of the facial palsy in the otomandibularis dysostosis. The authors proposed a treatment protocol depending on the patient's age. The patients before one year of age are treated with the I‚àö¬±igo's technique, which provide reinnervation to the affected muscles through a crossed facial nerve graft. After one-year old, the surgical approach is realised at five to seven years old to permit a physical therapy. The upper lip is reanimated by the lengthening temporalis myoplasty or by free muscle transplantation with nerve graft. The orbital area treatment of the paralyzed side can included a lengthening of the upper eyelid levator muscle, an asymmetric lateral tarsorraphy and a chondromucous graft.},

	abstract = {Facial paralysis is a significant functional and aesthetic handicap. Many techniques have been defined for facial reanimation. The aim of the study was to evaluate postoperative electromyographical (EMG) activity of temporalis muscle to assess the potential neural impairments related to the surgical procedure. Methodology: Four patients with facial paralysis were operated with the temporalis muscle tendon transfer technique. Simultaneous surface electromyographic (sEMG) activity at first postoperative year from the bilateral temporalis and masseter muscles was obtained at mandibular rest position and then during maximal clenching. Results: Patients were followed for a minimum period of 18 months. Surface electromyographic evaluations during passive state revealed similar values for the operated and contralateral side. Measurements during active "clench-smiling" of the jaw revealed similar amplitudes for both muscles of the operated side in all cases except case \#2. Case \#2 revealed lower values for both measurements of temporalis and masseter muscles of the operated side compared with the contralateral side. Dissonant results of case \#2 can be the consequence of impaired temporalis muscle activity because of the tension on the muscle as a consequence of overcorrection. Conclusion: Temporalis muscle transfer to the perioral region does not hinder contractility of the muscle as long as the facial deformity is not overcorrected.},

	abstract = {A total of 779 patients operated on for vestibular schwannoma mostly by the translabyrinthine approach in Denmark during the period 1976-2000 answered a questionnaire about various postoperative consequences. In this paper we describe the patients' facial function evaluated by professionals one year postoperatively and self-evaluated by each patient according to the House-Brackmann scale at the time of the questionnaire. The patients' self-evaluation was more pessimistic than that of the professionals with 26\% reporting House-Brackmann grade IV-VI, compared with 20\%. One hundred and seventeen (15\%) of 779 patients considered their facial palsy to be a big problem and 125 patients (16\%) were interested in surgical treatment for the sequelae of facial palsy. Seventy-eight (10\%) had already had some kind of operation, usually the VII-XII coaptation. Thirty-three of 61 patients who had already been operated on for facial palsy were interested in further surgical treatment. One hundred and ninety-five patients (25\%) had some kind of operation on the eye, mostly (88\%) a tarsorrhaphy. Reanimation procedures such as a palpebral gold weight or a spring, apparently still have a small place in Denmark. In conclusion, there seem to be a considerable and unmet need for surgical reanimation of facial function in patients with facial palsy after operations for vestibular schwannoma in Denmark.},

	abstract = {Background: Several methods of neural rehabilitation for facial paralysis using 12-7 transfers have been described. The purpose of this study is to report on a series for dynamic reinnervation of the paralyzed face by using a split 12-7 nerve transposition. The goals of this procedure are to minimize tongue morbidity and to provide good facial reinnervation. Methods: Prospective case series. Melolabial crease discursion, overall facial movement, and degree of tongue atrophy and mobility were recorded. Results: Thirteen patients underwent facial reanimation using a split hypoglossal-facial nerve transfer with postoperative follow-up to 58 months (range, 6-58 months). All patients achieved excellent rest symmetry and facial tone. Of 13 patients, 10 had measurable coordinated movement and discursion of their melolabial crease. Of 13 patients, 12 had mild to moderate ipsilateral tongue atrophy. The mean time to onset of visible reinnervation was 3 months. Conclusion: Split hypoglossal-facial nerve transposition provides good rehabilitation of facial nerve paralysis with reduced lingual morbidity. Long-term rest symmetry and potential learned movement can be achieved. This technique may provide a favorable alternative to the traditional method of complete hypoglossal sacrifice or jump grafting.},

	title = {A functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm to identify distinct cortical areas of facial function: a reliable localizer},
	abstract = {Background: Irreversible facial paralysis can be surgically treated by importing both a new neural and a new motor muscle supply. Various donor nerves can be used. If a nerve supply other than the facial nerve is used, the patient has to adapt to generate a smile. If branches of the fifth cranial nerve are used, the patient has to learn to clench teeth and smile. Currently, controversy exists regarding whether a patient develops a spontaneous smile if a nerve other than the facial nerve is used. The authors postulate that brain adaptation in facial palsy patients can occur because of neural plasticity. The authors aimed to determine whether functional magnetic resonance imaging could topographically differentiate activity between the facial nerve- and the trigeminal nerve-related cortical areas. Methods: A new paradigm of study using functional magnetic resonance imaging based on blood oxygen level-dependent signal activation was tested on 15 voluntary healthy subjects to find a sensitive localizer for teeth clenching and smiling. Subjects smiled to stimulate the facial nerve-related cortex, clenched their jaws to stimulate the trigeminal nerve-related cortex, and tapped their finger as a control condition. Results: Smiling and teeth clenching showed distinct and consistent areas of cortical activation. Trigeminal and facial motor cortex areas were found to be distinct areas with minimal overlapping. Conclusions: The authors successfully devised a functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm effective for activating specific areas corresponding to teeth clenching and smiling. This will allow accurate mapping of cortical plasticity in facial reanimation patients.},

	title = {A systematic algorithm for the management of lower lip asymmetry},
	abstract = {Purpose: An asymmetric smile, caused by loss of function of the lip depressors, can be functionally and cosmetically debilitating. Although some surgeons report excellent results with muscle transfer to the lower lip, many facial reanimation surgeons find that dynamic techniques do not consistently address the lower lip. Our objectives were to retrospectively review our outcomes after treatment of the asymmetric lower lip, and to propose a progressive, stepwise algorithm for the management of lower lip asymmetry in facial paralysis. Material/methods: Retrospective chart review was performed on all patients treated in a multidisciplinary facial nerve center with lower lip asymmetry over an eighteen month period. Treatment ranged from a temporary trial of lidocaine, to chemodenervation with botulinum toxin, to pedicled digastric muscle transfer, and/or resection of the nonparetic depressor labii inferioris (DLI). Results: Fifty-seven patients were treated with chemodenervation with botulinum toxin, four with anterior belly of the digastric transfer, and 3 with DLI resection. All patients with DLI resection had undergone chemodenervation to the contralateral lower lip with botulinum toxin and were pleased with the appearance of their smile. Conclusions: We have found that lower lip asymmetry is optimally managed by adherence to a standardized protocol that offers patients insight into the likely outcome of chemodenervation or surgery and progresses systematically from the reversible to the irreversible. We present our algorithm for the management of the asymmetric lower lip, which reflects this graduated approach and has resulted in high patient satisfaction.},

	abstract = {Objective: To determine the role of neurophysiological preoperative and intraoperative parameters in providing prognostic information regarding facial nerve (FN) function at 1 year after translabyrinthine acoustic neuroma (AN) resection surgery. Study design: Prospective observational study in a tertiary referral center. Patients treated via translabyrinthine surgical approach for sporadic AN microresection between December 2015 and 2018. Methods: Patients underwent preoperative (electroneurography-ENG, electromyography-EMG, and Blink Reflex-BR) and intraoperative (FN motor action potential-MAP and continuous EMG traces) neurophysiological studies. FN function was graded postoperatively at 1 year using House-Brackmann Scoring System. Results: Sixty-two patients were included in the analysis. Mean age was 53¬¨¬®¬¨¬±10 years and average tumor diameter was 23 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 9 mm. At 1 year a normal facial function was observed in 68\% of patients. In the univariate analysis a pathologic BR, low FN MAP values and ratios, and the presence of pathological neurotonic tracing (A-trains) on continuous EMG were associated with a poor facial nerve function outcome at 1 year postoperatively. Pathological preoperative BR testing and intraoperative A-trains showed a statistical significance also in the multivariable analysis, regardless of tumor size. Conclusions: Preoperative pathological BR testing and A-train activity on intraoperative EMG are correlated with poor FN outcomes at 1 year postoperative. This may provide important prognostic information to both patients and treating neuro-otologists. In the future this may guide preoperative and postoperative patient counselling and possibly optimize timing of facial nerve reanimation in selected patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Facial palsy can have significant functional and psychological impact. Dynamic facial reanimation methods have provided means of restoration of smile. There remains a dearth of quality of life data in children. The authors aim to assess patient reported outcomes in this underreported population. Methods: A retrospective review was performed of pediatric patients with facial palsy who had dynamic facial reanimation from 2009 to 2017 at a single institution. Patients were sent a digital Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE) questionnaire, a validated tool to assess patient quality of life. FaCE statements are grouped into 6 categories: facial movement, facial comfort, oral function, eye comfort, lacrimal control, and social control. Results: Twenty patients met inclusion criteria. Fourteen successfully completed the survey. With normal function being 100, our cohort scored: facial movement 38.7 ¬¨¬± 14.3; facial comfort 67.3 ¬¨¬± 23, oral function 75 ¬¨¬± 22.7, eye comfort 68.75 ¬¨¬± 18.2, lacrimal control 53.6 ¬¨¬± 32.5, social function 64.3 ¬¨¬± 25.6.

No correlation was found between facial movement scores and total scores (R2 {\textless} 0.01). There was a strong negative correlation between total scores and time since procedure (Spearman's rho R = -0.45). Conclusion: Our pediatric facial reanimation cohort demonstrated excellent social function, in contrast to a relatively lower facial movement score. The low facial movement score was mediated by low score for brow raise and was not correlated to overall FaCE score. Interestingly, overall FaCE score tended to decrease with time from procedure.},

An alternative to muscle free flaps is local muscle transposition, with the temporalis muscle transposition being the preferred procedure, because of its direction of pull when transposed. The present study aimed to compare outcomes of gracilis FFMT neurotised by the masseteric nerve and temporalis muscle transposition in longstanding facial palsy using patient-reported and aesthetic outcomes. Methods: A cross-sectional comparison of gracilis FFMT and temporalis muscle transpositions was performed. Pre- and postoperative excursion measures were obtained. Patients were asked to answer a satisfaction questionnaire, quality of life questionnaire (FaCE scale) and a depression and anxiety questionnaire (HADS). Laypeople were asked to rate the pre- and postoperative aesthetic appearance. Results: Of 28 eligible patients, 10 gracilis and 12 temporalis patients participated. No significant differences were found between both groups in postoperative quality of life or depression/anxiety. Layperson observers judged the aesthetic appearance to be similar. Conclusion: In the present study, gracilis FFMT did not lead to superior quality of life and aesthetic outcomes compared to temporalis muscle transpositions. The facial nerve specialist should perform the procedure he or she expects to lead to optimal results for the patient.},

Results: A large amount of quantitative information can be extracted directly, such as symmetry assessment in the contraction and relaxation trajectories. The fact that this plot is on scale allows also direct measurements such as maximal extensions. Even smiles that at the macro-scale are essentially symmetrical show at the micro-scale small asymmetries/variability.

While this procedure has proven its reliability, its problems with hemilingual atrophy (speech deglutition, drooling, mastication), hypertonia, synkinesis, and mimetic deficits indicate the need for a more perfect solution for facial paralysis. The jump interpositional graft hypoglossal facial anastomosis (JIGHFA) along with gold weight lid implantation and electromyographic (EMG) rehabilitation achieves substantial facial reanimation without hemilingual deficits. We present our results in 18 patients who underwent JIGHFA along with gold weight lid implantation and EMG rehabilitation for facial paralysis.

Anonymous retrospective information from questionnaires from 22 of 48 patients who were treated with the classic HFA was also presented. In properly selected patients, the JIGHFA technique is capable of achieving substantial facial reinnervation (House-Brackmann grade III or better) in 83.3\% of the patients without hemilingual sequelae which was seen in 45\% of the HFA patients. In contrast to the HFA, this procedure can be used by patients with concomitant lower cranial nerve paralysis (except hypoglossal), and bilateral facial paralysis.

	abstract = {Introduction: The current focus in dynamic reanimation of facial paralysis lies not only in restoring movement but also regaining smile spontaneity. It has been argued that a spontaneous smile can only be achieved using the contralateral facial nerve as donor via cross-face nerve grafting. Techniques based on the motor nerve to the masseter, however, have shown good rates of spontaneity as well. Patients and methods: Patients with complete facial paralysis reanimated using free gracilis to masseteric nerve or masseteric-to-facial nerve transfer were included. Patients were grouped according to gender comparing the rates of spontaneous smile. Results: Thirty-six patients (17 women and 19 men) underwent gracilis innervated by the masseteric nerve whereas masseteric-to-facial nerve transfer was performed in 30 cases (14 women and 16 men). For both techniques, women showed significantly higher rates of spontaneity. Additionally, women recovered spontaneity earlier than men. Conclusions: Along with providing a strong and reliable commissural pull, the motor nerve to the masseter is able to restore spontaneity as well. Women seem more prone to achieving it. Brain plasticity and the close relationship between the cortical areas of the masseteric and facial nerves are most likely the mechanisms underlying smile spontaneity.},

Of 94 patients with long-standing, unilateral facial palsy, 49 were treated using the latissimus dorsi muscle supplied by the split hypoglossal nerve, and 45 patients were treated using the latissmus dorsi muscle supplied by healthy contralateral buccal branch of the facial nerve.

	abstract = {Neurovascular free-muscle transfer for facial reanimation was performed as a secondary reconstructive procedure for 45 patients with facial paralysis resulting from ablative surgery in the parotid region. This intervention differs from neurovascular free-muscle transfer for treatment of established facial paralysis resulting from conditions such as congenital dysfunction, unresolved Bell palsy, Hunt syndrome, or intracranial morbidity, with difficulties including selection of recipient vessels and nerves, and requirements for soft-tissue augmentation. This article describes the authors' operative procedure for neurovascular free-muscle transfer after ablative surgery in the parotid region. Gracilis muscle (n = 24) or latissimus dorsi muscle (n = 21) was used for transfer. With gracilis transfer, recipient vessels comprised the superficial temporal vessels in 12 patients and the facial vessels in 12. For latissimus dorsi transfer, recipient vessels comprised the facial vessels in 16 patients and the superior thyroid artery and superior thyroid or internal jugular vein in four. Facial vessels on the contralateral side were used with interpositional graft of radial vessels in the remaining patient with latissimus dorsi transfer. Cross-face nerve grafting was performed before muscle transfer in 22 patients undergoing gracilis transfer. In the remaining two gracilis patients, the ipsilateral facial nerve stump was used as the primary recipient nerve. Dermal fat flap overlying the gracilis muscle was used for cheek augmentation in one patient. In the other 23 patients, only the gracilis muscle was used. With latissimus dorsi transfer, the ipsilateral facial nerve stump was used as the recipient nerve in three patients, and a cross-face nerve graft was selected as the recipient nerve in six. The contralateral facial nerve was selected as the recipient nerve in 12 patients, and a thoracodorsal nerve from the latissimus dorsi muscle segment was crossed through the upper lip to the primary recipient branches. A soft-tissue flap was transferred simultaneously with the latissimus muscle segment in three patients. Contraction of grafted muscle was not observed in two patients with gracilis transfer and in three patients with latissimus dorsi transfer. In one patient with gracilis transfer and one patient with latissimus dorsi transfer, acquired muscle contraction was excessive, resulting in unnatural smile animation. The recipient nerves for both of these patients were the ipsilateral facial nerve stumps, which were dissected by opening the facial nerve canal in the mastoid process. From the standpoint of operative technique, the one-stage transfer for latissimus dorsi muscle appears superior. Namely, a combined soft-tissue flap can provide sufficient augmentation for depression of the parotid region following wide resection. A long vascular stalk of thoracodorsal vessels is also useful for anastomosis, with recipient vessels available after extensive ablation and neck dissection.},

Objectives: In this study we compared the outcome of the classic end-to-end and the direct side-to-end HFA surgeries performed at our center in regards to the facial reanimation success rate and tongue-related morbidities. Methods: Twenty-six successive cases of HFA were enrolled. In 9 of them end-to-end anastomoses were performed, and 17 had direct side-to-end anastomoses. The House-Brackmann (HB) and Pitty and Tator (PT) scales were used to document surgical outcome. The hemiglossal atrophy, swallowing, and hypoglossal nerve function were assessed at follow-up. Results: The original pathology was vestibular schwannoma in 15, meningioma in 4, brain stem glioma in 4, and other pathologies in 3. The mean interval between facial palsy and HFA was 18 months (range: 0-60). The median follow-up period was 20 months. The PT grade at follow-up was worse in patients with a longer interval from facial palsy and HFA (P value: 0.041). The lesion type was the only other factor that affected PT grade (the best results in vestibular schwannoma and the worst in the other pathologies group, P value: 0.038). The recovery period for facial tonicity was longer in patients with radiation therapy before HFA (13.5 vs. 8.5 months) and those with a longer than 2-year interval from facial palsy to HFA (13.5 vs. 8.5 months). Although no significant difference between the side-to-end and the end-to-end groups was seen in terms of facial nerve functional recovery, patients from the side-to-end group had a significantly lower rate of lingual morbidities (tongue hemiatrophy: 100\% vs. 5.8\%, swallowing difficulty: 55\% vs. 11.7\%, speech disorder 33\% vs. 0\%). Conclusion: With the side-to-end HFA technique the functional restoration outcome is at least as good as that following the classic end-to-end HFA, but the complications related to the complete hypoglossal nerve transection can be avoided. Best results are achieved if this procedure is performed within the first 2 years after facial nerve injury. Patients with facial palsy of longer duration also have the chance for good functional restoration after HFA.},

	title = {Novel use of platysma for oral sphincter substitution or countering excessive pull of a free muscle},
	abstract = {Background: The present study demonstrates our experience with a novel use of the Platysma in facial reanimation, as a balancing procedure by counteracting an overactive free muscle transfer, and improving oral continence by re-establishing the oral sphincter mechanism. Material and methods: Twelve patients, nine female (75\%) and three male (25\%), with a mean age of thirty-eight years (range: 2-66) are presented. Of these, in seven patients (58\%) who had excessive excursion of the free muscle, the contralateral pedicled platysma was transferred to counteract the excessive pull. Four patients (33\%) underwent bilateral platysma transfer for oral sphincter restoration, while one (8\%) had ipsilateral platysma transfer. Evaluation of aesthetic and functional results was performed by a panel of three independent observers, and the long term efficacy of the procedure was assessed through a patient questionnaire. Results: All patients demonstrated significant upgrading of their oral competence associated with eating, drinking and smiling, as it was confirmed by the behavioural analysis (p{\textless}0.01). Six of the ten patients that were available, responded to the Quality of Life Questionnaire. Five out of six were satisfied with their mouth appearance when they smile and five patients have a regular diet and without drooling. Conclusion: A novel use of Platysma transposition is described that can substitute for a paralysed orbicularis oris muscle in restoring oral sphincter function or to counter balance an excessively active free muscle that was previously transferred for smile restoration. This novel Platysma transfer technique is intended to be used as an adjunct to other reanimation procedures.},

	abstract = {Introduction The masseter nerve has been used as a donor nerve for facial reanimation procedures due to the multiple advantages it offers; it has been generally considered that sacrifice of the masseter nerve does not alter the masticatory apparatus; however, there are no objective studies to support this claim. Objective To evaluate the impact that the use of the masseter nerve in dynamic facial reconstruction has on the electrical activity of the masseter muscle and on bite force. Materials and Methods An observational and prospective longitudinal study was performed measuring bite force and electrical activity of the masseter muscles before and 3 months after dynamic facial reconstructive surgery using the masseter nerve. An occlusal analyzer and surface electromyography were employed for measurements. Results The study included 15 patients with unilateral facial paralysis, with a mean age of 24.06 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 23.43. Seven patients were subjected to a masseter-buccal branch nerve transfer, whereas in eight patients, the masseter nerve was used as a donor nerve for gracilis free functional muscle transfer. Electrical activity of the masseter muscle was significantly reduced after surgery in both occlusal positions: from 140.86 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 65.94 to 109.68 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 68.04 ( p = 0.01) in maximum intercuspation and from 123.68 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 75.64 to 82.64 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 66.56 ( p = 0.01) in the rest position. However, bite force did not show any reduction, changing from 22.07 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 15.66 to 15.56 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 7.91 ( p = 0.1) after the procedure. Conclusion Masseter nerve transfer causes a reduction in electromyographic signals of the masseter muscle; however, bite force is preserved and comparable to preoperative status.},

Observations: Three pediatric patients with permanent facial paralysis underwent OTTT using our modified technique between August 30, 2010, and January 23, 2012. Outcomes were assessed by the surgeons, patients, and patient families, with the longest follow-up period being 13 months after surgery. Two patients were 4 years old at the time of surgery, and the third patient was 17 years old. All underwent upper eyelid gold weight placement and OTTT. The hospital length of stay was 1 to 2 nights. By the first postoperative visit, all patients exhibited improved symmetry at rest, creation of a melolabial crease, and voluntary movement of the oral commissure and smile production without physical therapy. Conclusions and relevance: The OTTT for dynamic facial reanimation in children seems to be safe and effective. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of this procedure in pediatric patients. This procedure has an advantage over free muscle transfer procedures in achieving immediate dynamic reanimation in a single-stage surgical procedure, without significant additional donor site morbidity.

	title = {Modified technique for rehabilitation of facial paralysis using autogenous fascia lata grafts},
	abstract = {Purpose: In this retrospective study we used a modified surgical technique for miDFace reanimation in patients with facial nerve paralysis. Facial atonicity can cause functional impairment regarding speech articulation, oral competence, breathing, and eyelid closure. Furthermore, esthetic and psychological aspects play an important role in patients' emotional interaction and social integration. The chosen rehabilitative technique should offer support against prolapse of facial structures and remedy of functional disabilities and, thereby, prevention of social stigmatization due to disease-related changes in appearance. Materials and methods: Between 2005 and 2013, fascia lata grafts were used as static support in 15 cases of unilateral facial paralysis. Two fascia lata grafts were subcutaneously inserted in the upper and lower lips crossing the midline and sutured at 4 points, including the unaffected part of the orbicularis oris muscle and modiolus. The slings were suspended against the zygomatic arch with an osteosynthesis plate. Results: The patients perceived surgery results as considerably improving their appearance, speech, and alimentation. In 93.3\% of cases, no postoperative complications occurred. The follow-up results (8 months to 8 years) remained stable. Conclusions: This retrospective study showed the advantages of static facial reanimation in appropriate cases. The bony fixated support of the fascial slings allows an immediate improvement of facial symmetry. Additional attachment points including the unaffected part of the orbicularis oris muscle and the use of 2 independent fascia lata slings allow a more accurate adjustment of suspension forces and an incomplete dynamic reanimation of the mouth corner. With respect to its simplicity and minimal invasiveness, this surgical procedure is associated with low morbidity and rapid improvement of the patient's esthetic appearance.},

Our technique of using a muscle component to fill the cheek defect was based on our experience with free muscle transfer in facial reanimation. In comparison with adipose tissue, muscle tissue does not show a tendency for ptosis because of its consistency and firm attachment of the muscle surface to the surrounding tissues. These cases demonstrate the possibility for the use of simultaneous dissection of the face and flaps, and the reliability of the vascular pedicle. The stability of the abdominal wall was secured by closure of the rectus sheath over Teflon mesh, which has been proven to prevent hernia.

	abstract = {Background: Three patients with large intratemporal facial schwannomas underwent tumor removal and facial nerve reconstruction with hypoglossal anastomosis. The surgical strategy for the cases was tailored to the location of the mass and its extension along the facial nerve. Aim: To provide data on the different clinical aspects of facial nerve schwannoma, the appropriate planning for management, and the predictive outcomes of facial function. Patients: Three patients with facial schwannomas (two men and one woman, ages 45, 36, and 52 years, respectively) who presented to the clinic between 2009 and 2015 were reviewed. They all had hearing loss but normal facial function. All patients were operated on with radical tumor removal via mastoidectomy and subtotal petrosectomy and simultaneous cranial nerve (CN) 7- CN 12 anastomosis. Results: Multiple segments of the facial nerve were involved ranging in size from 3 to 7 cm. In the follow-up period of 9 to 24 months, there was no tumor recurrence. Facial function was scored House-Brackmann grades II and III, but two patients are still in the process of functional recovery. Conclusion: Conservative treatment with sparing of the nerve is considered in patients with small tumors. Excision of a large facial schwannoma with immediate hypoglossal nerve grafting as a primary procedure can provide satisfactory facial nerve function. One of the disadvantages of performing anastomosis is that there is not enough neural tissue just before the bifurcation of the main stump to provide neural suturing without tension because middle fossa extension of the facial schwannoma frequently involves the main facial nerve at the stylomastoid foramen. Reanimation should be processed with extensive backward mobilization of the hypoglossal nerve.},

To obtain better cosmetic results we developed newly shaped thinner weights. Four instead of three perforations in each weight enable better fixation to soft tissue. Since 40\% of all cases also required additional surgery to rehabilitate other portion of the face, polytetrafluoroethylene (Goretex) soft-tissue patches were used for suspension to help correct miDFacial and perioral asymmetry.

	abstract = {Background and purpose: Facial nerve paralysis significantly decreases the quality of life in patients after skull base tumors surgery. There are different options for surgical repair of the nerve. One of the most effective methods is the anastomosis of the distal trunk of the facial nerve with the proximal trunk of the hypoglossal nerve or with hypoglossal loop. Material and methods: Thirteen hypoglosso-facial anastomoses had been performed in our department between 1999 and 2003. In all patients the facial nerve paralysis was due to the surgery in its proximity. In one case the patient suffered from petroclival chordoma, in one case ameloblastoma, one was with petroclival meningioma and the rest of cases were after vestibular schwannoma. The follow-up period lasted from 6 months to three years. The final result was expressed in House-Brackmann scale (HB) describing facial muscle strength. Results: In two cases there was no improvement (HB 6), in two cases barely perceptible motion (HB 5), in five obvious weekness with disfiguring assymetry (HB 4) and in four obvious but not disfiguring dysfunction (HB 3). There was only one postoperative complication haematoma at the place of anastomosis requiring evacuation. Conclusion: Hypoglosso-facial anastomosis remains one of the most important techniques of the reanimation of the paralysed face. Its efficacy is limited, but it is a relatively safe procedure.},

Even weak movement is valuable and can be augmented with secondary static operations. Post-operative radiotherapy does not seem to affect the final outcome of facial function. Objectives: During radical parotidectomy, the sacrifice of the facial nerve results in severe disfigurement of the face. Data on the principles and outcome of facial nerve reconstruction and reanimation after radical parotidectomy are limited and no consensus exists on the best practice. Method: This study retrospectively reviewed all patients having undergone radical parotidectomy and immediate facial nerve reconstruction with a free, non-vascularized nerve graft at the Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland during the years 1990-2010. There were 31 patients (18 male; mean age = 54.7 years; range = 30-82) and 23 of them had a sufficient follow-up time. Results: Facial nerve function recovery was seen in 18 (78\%) of the 23 patients with a minimum of 2-year follow-up and adequate reporting available.

	abstract = {Lesions of the temporal bone and cerebellopontine angle and their management can result in facial nerve paralysis. When the nerve deficit is not amenable to primary end-to-end repair or interpositional grafting, nerve transposition can be used to accomplish the goals of restoring facial tone, symmetry, and voluntary movement. The most widely used nerve transposition is the hypoglossal-facial nerve anastamosis, of which there are several technical variations. Previously we described a technique of single end-to-side anastamosis using intratemporal facial nerve mobilization and parotid release. This study further characterizes the results of this technique with a larger patient cohort and longer-term follow-up. The design of this study is a retrospective chart review and the setting is an academic tertiary care referral center. Twenty-one patients with facial nerve paralysis from proximal nerve injury at the cerebellopontine angle underwent facial-hypoglossal neurorraphy with parotid release. Outcomes were assessed using the Repaired Facial Nerve Recovery Scale, questionnaires, and patient photographs. Of the 21 patients, 18 were successfully reinnervated to a score of a B or C on the recovery scale, which equates to good oral and ocular sphincter closure with minimal mass movement. The mean duration of paralysis between injury and repair was 12.1 months (range 0 to 36 months) with a mean follow-up of 55 months. There were no cases of hemiglossal atrophy, paralysis, or subjective dysfunction. Direct facial-hypoglossal neurorrhaphy with parotid release achieved a functional reinnervation and good clinical outcome in the majority of patients, with minimal lingual morbidity. This technique is a viable option for facial reanimation and should be strongly considered as a surgical option for the paralyzed face.},

	abstract = {Background: Using functioning free muscle transplantation (FFMT) for facial paralysis and postparalysis facial synkinesis reconstruction is our preferred technique. Gracilis was the first choice of muscle. Three motor neurotizers: cross-face nerve graft (CFNG), spinal accessory nerve (XI) and masseter nerve (V3) have been used as neurotizers for different indications. Methods: A total of 362 cases of facial reanimation with FFMT were performed between 1986 and 2015. Of these, 350 patients with 361 FFMT were enrolled: 272 (78\%) patients were treated by CFNG-gracilis, 56 (15\%) by XI-gracilis, and 22 (6\%) by V3-gracilis. Smile excursion score, cortical adaptation stage with tickle test for spontaneous smile, facial synkinesis, satisfaction score by questionnaire, and functional facial grading were used for outcome assessment. Results: The CFNG-gracilis in a 2-stage procedure achieved most natural and spontaneous smile when longer observation (‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö¬¢‚Äö√Ñ¬¢2 years) was followed. The single-stage procedure using the XI-gracilis has proven a good alternative. V3-gracilis provided high smile excursion score in the shortest rehabilitation period, but never obtained spontaneous smile. Conclusions: The CFNG-gracilis remains our first choice for facial paralysis reconstruction which can achieve natural and spontaneous smile. XI- or V3-gracilis can be selected as a save procedure when CFNG-gracilis fails. The V3-gracilis is indicated in some specific conditions, such as bilateral M‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√ábius syndrome, older patients (age, {\textgreater}70 years), or patients with malignant disease.},

However, some patients report unsatisfactory outcomes, such as difficulty in maintaining resting or smiling symmetry, due to persistent flaccid facial palsy. Here we evaluated the functional outcomes of transferring the masseteric branch of the trigeminal nerve to the facial nerve adjunct to facial nerve graft. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of seven patients who underwent facial reanimation surgery between 2014 and 2016. The patients were divided into two groups according to the type of facial reanimation surgery: group A, masseteric nerve innervation with interposition graft; group B, interposition graft only. The postoperative resting symmetry and dynamic movement were compared. Results: Facial contraction was first observed in group A at 4 months and in group B at 7.3 months. Most of the patients achieved reliable resting symmetry; however, one patient in group B exhibited unsatisfactory facial weakness on the affected side. Group A patients showed better dynamic movement than group B patients. Eye closure, oral excursion and oral continence were better in group A than in group B patients. Smile symmetry in both groups was similar due to hyperkinetic movement in group A patients and flaccidity in group B patients. Conclusions: Dual innervation of the masseteric branch of the trigeminal nerve improves the dynamic movement of paralysed facial muscles and shortens the recovery period in patients with iatrogenic facial palsy.},

	title = {Rehabilitation of facial palsy by the lengthening temporalis myoplastie: {A} case report},
	abstract = {Introduction: The lengthening temporalis myoplasty (LTM) is defined as a transfer of the entire temporal muscle from the coronoid process to the labial commissure reinserted into the orbicularis muscle. Presentation of case: a 60-year-old man with grade III longstanding facial paralysis of the right hemi-face secondary to a right total parotidectomy. The surgery was performed for the rehabilitation of the right hemi-facial side by the lengthening temporalis myoplasty. The follow-up was favorable with improvement of the facial dynamics. Discussion: Surgical management of the longstanding facial palsy is a real challenge. The lengthening temporalis myoplasty offers several advantages; technically is a simple. This technique was demonstrated in severe neglected facial palsy and is performed when there is a definitive complete, or almost complete, loss of the facial nerve and the trigeminal is preserved. Effective rehabilitation through training and physical therapy is necessary to optimize results. Conclusion: Facial palsy should no longer be permanent, surgical techniques as lengthening temporalis myoplasty with early postoperative physiotherapy leads to good results. Preoperative planning and early recognition of issues can avoid postoperative complications.},

	title = {Facial reanimation utilizing combined orthodromic temporalis muscle flap and end-to-side cross-face nerve grafts},
	abstract = {Background: Individuals with facial paralysis of 6 months or more without evidence of clinical or electromyographic improvement have been successfully reanimated utilizing an orthodromic temporalis transfer in conjunction with end-to-side cross-face nerve grafts. The temporalis muscle insertion is released from the coronoid process of the mandible and sutured to a fascia lata graft that is secured distally to the commissure and paralyzed hemilip. The orthodromic transfer of the temporalis muscle overcomes the concave temporal deformity and zygomatic fullness produced by the turning down of the central third of the muscle (Gillies procedure) while yielding stronger muscle contraction and a more symmetric smile. The muscle flap is combined with cross-face sural nerve grafts utilizing end-to-side neurorrhaphies to import myelinated motor fibers to the paralyzed muscles of facial expression in the miDFace and perioral region. Cross-face nerve grafting provides the potential for true spontaneous facial motion. We feel that the synergy created by the combination of techniques can perhaps produce a more symmetrical and synchronized smile than either procedure in isolation. Methods: Nineteen patients underwent an orthodromic temporalis muscle flap in conjunction with cross-face (buccal-buccal with end-to-side neurorrhaphy) nerve grafts. To evaluate the symmetry of the smile, we measured the length of the two hemilips (normal and affected) using the CorelDRAW X3 software. Measurements were obtained in the pre- and postoperative period and compared for symmetry. Results: There was significant improvement in smile symmetry in 89.5 \% of patients. Conclusion: Orthodromic temporalis muscle transfer in conjunction with cross face nerve grafts creates a synergistic effect frequently producing an aesthetic, symmetric smile.

	abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to measure the effect of the static reanimation operation administered to patients with facial paralysis on nasal function area by comparing patients' preoperative and postoperative subjective perception of the nasal airflow. Materials and method: We applied the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scale to 13 patients who underwent static reanimation because of facial palsies, both preoperatively and postoperatively, and results were compared statistically. The changes in nasal base angulation were recorded and compared based on the photographs of patients taken before and after the surgery. Results: Following the static reanimation operation, 76\% (10/13) of the patients reported a subjective improvement in the nasal airflow, whereas 24\% (3/13) did not report any change. Mean preoperative and postoperative NOSE scale scores were 66.92 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 9.90 and 36.15 ¬¨¬®¬¨¬± 9.61, respectively. The change in mean NOSE scale score was statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.001). In the preoperative and postoperative comparison of the photographs taken from the front view of the patients, a decreased nasal base angulation compared with preoperative period was detected in 8 (61.6\%) patients. Conclusions: A statistically significant increase in subjective perception about nasal function was observed after the static facial reanimation; however, it is not certain whether this effect can be considered persistent. Long-term studies conducted on a larger patient population will provide beneficial results.},

	abstract = {Objective: To evaluate functional recovery after facial-hypoglossal nerve transfer with direct coaptation of the intratemporal part of the facial nerve. Study design: Retrospective study. Setting: University-based tertiary referral center. Patients: Nine patients who underwent facial-hypoglossal transfer surgery between 2001 and 2006 to treat a unilateral complete facial nerve palsy. Intervention: The facial nerve is mobilized in the temporal bone, transsected at the second genu, transferred and directly coaptated to a partially incised hypoglossal nerve. Main outcome measures: The House-Brackmann grading system was used to evaluate facial nerve reinnervation. Tongue atrophy and movements were documented. Quality of life related to facial function was assessed using the validated Facial Disability Index. Results: A House-Brackmann Grade III (86\%) was achieved in six patients, and Grade IV (14\%) in one patient with an average follow-up of 22 months (range, 12-48 mo). Two patients had a follow-up of less than 12 months after surgery, and reinnervation was still in progress. In none of the patients who were operated on was tongue atrophy or impaired movement observed. Postoperative Facial Disability Index scores (mean, 71.8 +/- standard deviation [SD] 10.6) for physical functioning and social functioning (mean, 85.7 +/- SD 9.8) were increased for all patients when compared with preoperative scores (mean, 28.6 +/- SD 9.0; mean, 37.7 +/- SD 14.4, respectively). Conclusion: The facial-hypoglossal nerve transfer with direct coaptation of the intratemporal part of the facial nerve offers good functional results with low lingual morbidity and improved quality of life. The technique is straightforward, relatively simple, and should be considered as first option for reanimation of traumatic facial nerve lesions.},

	abstract = {Importance: A multivector functional muscle flap that closely simulates the biomechanical effects of facial muscle groups is essential for complete smile restoration after facial paralysis. Objective: To determine the feasibility of a multivector gracilis muscle flap design for reanimation after facial paralysis and to analyze the effect on the smile display zone. Design, setting, and participants: Prospective analysis of patients who underwent a double paddle multivector gracilis flap for complete facial paralysis between June 2015 and December 2016 was carried out in a tertiary hospital. Interventions: The gracilis muscle was harvested as a double paddle flap and inserted along 2 vectors for facial reanimation. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome measures were: (1) dental display (the number of maxillary teeth displayed on paralyzed vs normal sides), (2) exposed maxillary gingival scaffold width, (3) interlabial gap at midline and canine, (4) facial asymmetry index (FAI), and (5) dynamic periorbital wrinkling. Results: There were 10 women and 2 men between ages 20 and 64 years (mean [SD], 46 [15] years). Five flaps were reinnervated with facial and masseteric nerves, 5 with masseteric nerve only, and 2 with crossfacial nerve only. There was functional muscle recovery in all cases. On average there was additional 3.1 maxillary teeth exposed posttreatment when smiling (5.5 vs 8.6; CI, 7.9 to 16.6; P {\textless} .001). The mean exposed maxillary gingival scaffold width improved from 31.5 mm to 43.7 mm (95\% CI, 1.9 to 4.3; P {\textless} .001). There was no significant difference in interlabial exposure at midline (7.1 mm vs 7.7 mm; CI, -1.5 to 2.7; P = .56) but a 56.4\% improvement at the level of the canines (3.9 vs 6.1; CI, 0.1 to 4.3; P = .04). The mean FAI when smiling was reduced from 9.1 mm to 4.5 mm (CI, -8.0 to -1.2; P = .01). Dynamic wrinkling of the periorbital area with smiling was noted in 4 patients. Conclusions and relevance: The gracilis flap can be reliably designed as a functional double paddle muscle flap for a multivector facial reanimation. The multivector gracilis flap design is effective in improving all components of the smile display zone and has the potential for producing periorbital-wrinkling characteristic of a Duchenne smile.

	title = {Facial nerve transfer for facial reanimation with parotidoplasty approach},
	abstract = {Background: Facial paralysis has a profound impact on quality of life in affected individuals, primarily through loss of verbal and nonverbal communication. Common facial nerve reanimation techniques include coaptation to the masseteric or hypoglossal nerve. Most techniques require nerve grafts to achieve a tension-free neurorrhaphy. Our report aims to show a surgical adaption to current facial reanimation procedures using a partial parotidoplasty approach in order to avoid challenges caused by interpositional nerve grafts through primary neurorrhaphy. Patients and methods: The modified surgical approach was performed on four patients, aged 30-67. Length of paralysis ranged from 6 to 13 months. Cause of paralysis included one patient with Bell's palsy in one patient, prior surgery in two patients, and traumatic fracture in the remaining patient. A modified Blair approach is used to expose the parotid capsule. The facial nerve is dissected proximally toward the stylomastoid foramen and distally toward the masseter. The parotid gland substance is sectioned overlying each branch of the facial nerve using ultrasonic dissection or hemostatic scalpel, allowing mobilization of the proximal segment and upper and lower divisions of the facial nerve. The superficial lobe of the parotid is preserved in most cases. The House-Brackmann (H-B) functional scale was used to assess facial nerve function pre- and post-operatively. Results: All patients showed H-B score V or greater prior to reanimation. Follow-up was conducted at 3-, 6-, and 12-months in all patients with resultant improvement of H-B scores of I in three patients and II in the remaining patient. Only one complication was noted, with one patient developing a right postauricular hematoma that was adequately managed without sequelae. All remaining patients experienced an uncomplicated post-operative course. Conclusion: Our modified approach to facial nerve reanimation works well with a planned parotidoplasty allowing for successful reanimation outcomes without the need for interpositional grafting. This technique may be considered in masseteric and hemi-hypoglossal nerve transfers for the reinnervation of facial muscles.},

	abstract = {Importance: Facial paralysis affects patients' physical, social, and psychological function. Dynamic smile reanimation can mitigate these effects, but there are limited data to guide the surgeon in selecting the best reanimation procedure for each patient. Objective: To compare quantitative changes in oral commissure symmetry and smile excursion following temporalis tendon transfer (T3) and gracilis free muscle transfer. Design, setting, and participants: Retrospective case series of 28 adults with unilateral facial paralysis seeking dynamic lower facial reanimation at a tertiary academic medical center between July 1, 2010, and July 30, 2014. Data were analyzed from May 1, 2016, to June 30, 2016. Interventions: Minimally invasive T3 (n = 14) compared with gracilis free muscle transfer (n = 14). Main outcomes and measures: Measured symmetry of the oral commissure between the healthy and paralyzed sides in the horizontal, vertical, and angular dimension and excursion of the paralyzed commissure following reanimation compared with the healthy commissure. Results: Of the 28 patients, 19 (68\%) were women; mean (SD) age was 51.7 (17) years. Commissure symmetry during smile improved significantly for the T3 patients in the vertical and angular dimensions, and the gracilis free muscle transfer patients had significant improvement in the vertical and horizontal dimensions. Commissure excursion significantly improved in both groups following surgery, with a larger improvement seen in the gracilis free muscle transfer group (11.3 mm; 95\% CI, 7.0 to 15.5 mm) compared with the T3 group (4.8 mm; 95\% CI, 0.2 to 9.3 mm), with a mean difference of 6.5 mm (95\% CI, 0.7 to 12.4 mm; Cohen d, 0.86). Postoperative smile excursion of the paralyzed side was within 1.0 mm of the healthy side in the gracilis free muscle transfer group (95\% CI, -2.1 to 4.0 mm). Conclusions and relevance: Temporalis tendon transfer and gracilis free muscle transfer both improve oral commissure symmetry and excursion in facial paralysis. The improvement in smile excursion appears to be larger in patients treated with gracilis free muscle transfer and, on average, the excursion approximates the contralateral healthy side.},

	title = {Long-term facial nerve function following facial reanimation after translabyrinthine vestibular schwannoma surgery: {A} comparison between sural grafting and {VII}-{XII} anastomosis},
	abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the recovery of long-term facial nerve function between patients who received sural grafts and those who underwent hypoglossal-facial anastomosis techniques following translabyrinthine vestibular schwannoma surgery. This study included 25 patients with vestibular schwannomas treated with translabyrinthine tumor removal. All patients had large tumors with a mean tumor size of 3.12 cm. Of these patients, six had progressive tumor enlargement symptoms and had been treated previously with stereotactic irradiation. Preoperatively, all patients had normal facial functions, and total tumor removal with a translabyrinthine approach was achieved in all cases. During surgery, the facial nerve was interrupted in all 25 patients. Two types of facial reanimation were performed. Sural grafts were placed in 13 patients and hypoglossal-facial (VII-XII) anastomosis was performed in the other 12. Facial nerve function and surgical outcomes were observed upon discharge, in the short term (one year following surgery), and in the long term (three years following surgery). Total facial paresis was observed in all patients upon discharge. In the sural graft group, House-Brackmann grade III facial function was achieved in four patients upon short-term evaluation and in ten upon long-term evaluation, while House-Brackmann grade IV facial function was achieved in nine patients upon short-term evaluation and three in the long term. In the VII-XII anastomosis group, House-Brackmann grade III facial function was achieved in two patients in the short term and eight in the long term, and House-Brackmann grade IV facial function was achieved in ten patients in the short term and four in the long term. There was a statistically significant difference in the facial recovery results between the short- and long-term follow-up periods. The sural graft group exhibited a marked improvement in results compared with the VII-XII anastomosis group, but no statistically significant difference in facial function was observed between the two facial reanimation groups at either the short- or long-term follow-up. In the sural graft group, synkinesia, noted in three patients, was the most frequently observed complication. Claudication was common upon discharge (four patients), but diminished during follow-up. Disarticulation was the most common complication in the VII-XII anastomosis group (five patients); numbness of the tongue was the second most common complication (four patients). None of the patients developed dysphagia. Facial reanimation is an effective procedure for the surgical rehabilitation of static and dynamic facial nerve functions. Significant improvement in facial nerve function may occur more than three years after surgery. Despite morbidities such as synkinesia, the sural graft technique demonstrates greater improvements in facial nerve function than VII-XII anastomosis in the short and long term following surgery, but this conclusion requires confirmation by larger studies with a greater number of patients.},

	abstract = {Background: In managing late facial paralysis, association of cross-facial nerve grafting and free muscle transfer proves superior to any other method of mid-face reanimation. Nevertheless, predicting functional recovery remains a struggle, and in a minority of patients, results are deceiving. In this study, cases of fair or moderate outcomes from a free muscle transfer received a segmental temporalis transposition to upgrade the functional and aesthetic results. Methods: From 1981 to 2007, 153 patients received a free muscle transfer for smile restoration in the authors' center. Of all patients, 72 percent (110 patients) required a third stage of revisions. In 41 cases, mini-temporalis transfer was used to augment moderate outcomes of a free muscle transfer. The exclusion criterion was less than 3 months' follow-up; thus, six patients were not evaluated. Each patient was videotaped at three successive time points (preoperatively, following free muscle transfer, and following mini-temporalis transfer). Five independent observers graded patients' videos using a five-category scale from poor to excellent. Results: In all of the patients, the averaged scores were higher after free muscle transfer in comparison with the preoperative scores (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p {\textless} 0.0001). After mini-temporalis transfer, 97.1 percent of the patients had scores that were increased further and 2.8 percent had the same scores. Alopecia along the coronal incision was seen in four patients, and hollowing of the infratemporal fossa was seen in five. Conclusion: Analysis of these clinical data supports the use of mini-temporalis transfer as a safe and reliable method of correcting imperfect outcomes following a free muscle transfer for smile restoration.},

The segmental latissimus dorsi was taken from the distal part of the muscle so that the muscle flap had an ultra-long neurovascular pedicle of 13 to 17.5 cm in length. The muscle flap was made thinner by splitting the segmental muscle. The split segmental muscle flap was transferred to the paralyzed side of the face with its ultra-long neurovascular pedicle passing through a tunnel in the upper lip to the normal side of the face. The neurovascular pedicle of the muscle flap was anastomosed with the facial nerve, artery, and veins, respectively, on the normal side of the face. The operation was designed without the cross-facial nerve graft stage. From 1986 to October of 1997, 86 patients with longstanding facial paralysis were treated in our department. The duration of facial palsy in this series ranged from 1.5 to 51 years. A satisfactory result was obtained in 80 cases, evaluated at 8 months to 2 years postoperatively. The expression movement of the soft tissues of the face can be seen not only over transferred muscle but also on the paralyzed muscle covered by the splitting muscle flap. It is supposed that this is the result of muscle-muscle neurolization. Study of 66 specimens of latissimus dorsi muscle in the cadavers is discussed.},

	abstract = {Objective In this study, we aimed to examine the topical anatomic landmarks of the facial nerve (facial nerve areas) and their application in cases of extratemporal facial nerve injury in maxillofacial trauma. Materials and methods We analyzed 25 maxillofacial trauma patients with facial paralysis who underwent facial nerve reanimation surgery at the Ho Chi Minh City National Hospital of Odonto-Stomatology. The characteristics of each trauma case, including the mechanism of injury, the length of the facial injury, and the location/position of injury, were recorded. The association of the injured nerves with the trauma characteristics and the external landmarks of the facial danger zones was analyzed. Results The buccal branches had the highest rate of paralysis (22/25 cases), followed by zygomatic branches (15/25), frontal branches (11/25), marginal branches (6/25), and the main trunk (1/25). There were four areas related to the external facial nerve landmarks (facial nerve areas) that helped us find the affected nerves: wounds in Area 1 resulted in frontal branch paralysis in five out of eight cases (62.5\%); wounds in Area 2 resulted in zygomatic branch paralysis in 8/13 cases (61.5\%) and buccal branch paralysis in 12/12 cases (100\%); wounds in Area 3 resulted in marginal branch paralysis in 5/10 cases (50\%); and wounds in Area 4 alone resulted in main trunk paralysis in one out of four cases or at least two main branches in three out of four cases. Conclusion Extratemporal facial paralysis after facial trauma can be complex and highly variable, leading to difficulty in finding and repairing facial nerves. Thorough clinical examination and evaluation of trauma characteristics can aid in the identification of facial paralysis and repair. Mapping facial wounds using the four anatomic surface landmarks (Areas 1-4 as outlined in this research) helped us anticipate which branches might be traumatized and estimate the position of the distal and proximal endings to repair the nerves in all cases.},

The purpose of this study was to compare the rate of movement dissociation and spontaneity of men versus women reanimated with gracilis transfer neurotized to the masseteric nerve. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 27 patients who underwent facial paralysis reanimation with microvascular gracilis transplants neurotized to the ipsilateral masseteric nerve. Patients were classified by sex, comparing age at surgery, denervation time, and follow-up, as well as the rates of movement dissociation and smile spontaneity. Results: After reanimation with gracilis to masseteric nerve, movement dissociation and spontaneity were higher in women during the first year after onset of facial movement (p=.02 and p=.01, respectively). Conclusion: After reanimation with masseteric nerve, women seem to be able to smile spontaneously and independently from teeth clenching earlier than men.},

	abstract = {Background. Large oncosurgical defects of the cheek present a challenging reconstructive problem, especially when skin resections are combined with other procedures such as parotidectomy and/or neck dissection. Methods. We present our experience with the deep plane cervicofacial flap (DPCFF) for reconstructing zone 1 (n = 7), zone 2 (n = 6), and zone 3 (n = 5) cheek defects resulting from excision of primary cutaneous malignancies (n = 13) and metastatic parotid (n = 6) and/or neck (n = 4) disease with skin involvement. The patients were between 65 and 88 years of age (mean, 76.7 years). The design of the flap was determined by the location of the defect and the need for simultaneous parotidectomy and/or neck dissection. Sixteen flaps were anteriorly based, whereas two were posteriorly based. Results. Twelve patients underwent simultaneous parotidectomy (n = 11) and/or neck dissection (n = 10) and/or facial reanimation procedures (n = 6). The size of the cutaneous defects ranged from 4 × 4 to 10 × 10 (mean, 5.6 × 5.3) cm. Eight patients received postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy to the primary site and/or parotid bed and neck. Superficial marginal flap necrosis occurred in one of the three patients who received definitive radiotherapy before salvage surgery and repair with DPCFF. Other complications included one hematoma, one ectropion, and one retraction of the lower eyelid. Apart from mild facial contour deficiency in two patients, excellent functional and cosmetic outcome with good skin color and texture match were achieved in all patients. Conclusions. The DPCFF is a versatile reconstructive technique in head and neck surgery. It provides a simple solution for a variety of cheek defects as an excellent alternative to regional or free tissue transfer. It can be used when simultaneous parotidectomy and/or neck dissection and/or facial reanimation procedures are required. This composite musculo-fasciocutaneous unit is reliable with excellent vascularity, because it has an axial blood supply. Division of the facial suspensory ligaments during elevation of the flap in the sub-superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) plane increases the mobility of this flap, which facilitates transfer. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	title = {Dynamic procedures for facial nerve reconstruction},
	abstract = {In this article the indications and surgical treatment options for patients with facial nerve palsy are discussed. A distinction is made between static and dynamic surgical procedures. Static reconstructions for example are used to restore the eyelid closure function. For smile reconstruction, which is important for the psychosocial life of the patient, dynamic procedures are used. Depending on the duration of the facial nerve paralysis, there are several possibilities to restore the smile. In this work the masseteric branch transposition to the buccal branch, the hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis, the Labbé procedure and the gracilis flap as a free muscle transplant are discussed. The surgical procedures are compared and the advantages and disadvantages of the intervention are presented. A spontaneous smile is aimed, this cannot always be achieved. With the masseteric branch transposition to the buccal branch and the Labbé procedure the smile is initially triggered by chewing. A spontaneous smile is possible through cortical adaptation. With the gracilis flap, however, a nerve anastomosis with the contralateral 'healthy' facial nerve is possible, either directly or via a so-called cross facial nerve grafting, whereby a spontaneous smile can be achieved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Facial paralysis is a congenital or acquired disorder of varying severity leading to an asymmetric or absent facial expression. It represents an important debilitation from both esthetic and functional points of view. In this article we report our experience with patients treated with gracilis muscle transplantation innervated by the motor nerve to the masseter muscle. We discuss the surgical technique and the functional and esthetic results and evaluate the effectiveness of this donor nerve in providing adequate innervation to the muscle transfer for lower facial reanimation. Materials and Methods: Fifteen patients with unilateral facial paralysis were seen and surgically treated at the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy, between 2003 and 2007. In this study we report on 8 cases treated with gracilis muscle transfer reinnervated by the motor nerve to the masseter muscle. Results: In this series all free-muscle transplantations survived transfer, and no flap was lost. Facial symmetry at rest and while smiling was excellent or good in all patients, and we observed a significant improvement in speech and oral competence. With practice, the majority of patients developed the ability to smile spontaneously and without jaw movement. Conclusions: We consider the masseter motor nerve a powerful and reliable donor nerve, allowing us to obtain a commissure and upper lip movement similar to those of the normal site for amount and direction. This is why we think that there may be a larger role for the masseter motor nerve for innervation of patients with unilateral facial paralysis who would otherwise have been considered candidates for cross-facial nerve graft innervation of the muscle transfer. © 2010 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.},

	title = {Reconstruction of complex defects of the extracranial facial nerve: technique of “the trifurcation approach”},
	abstract = {Purpose: Reconstruction of complex defects of facial nerve (FN) after extensive cancer surgery requires individualized solutions. We describe the trifurcation technique as a modification of the combined approach on example of two patients with locally advanced parotid cancer. Methods: Due to perineural invasion, extensive resection of the FN from the mastoid segment to the peripheral branches was required. For reanimation of the upper face, a complex cervical plexus graft was sutured end-to-end to the mastoid segment of the FN trunk. The branches of the graft enabled reanimation of three peripheral temporal and zygomatic branches. The mandibular branch was sutured end-to-side to the hypoglossal nerve (hypoglossal–facial nerve transfer, HFNT). Additionally, the buccal branch was independently reanimated with ansa cervicalis. Results: Facial reanimation was successful in both patients. Good resting tone and voluntary movement were achieved with a mild degree of synkinesis after 13 months. Patient 1 showed the Sunnybrook (SB) composite score 69 [76 (voluntary movement score) − 0 (resting symmetry score) − 7 (synkinesis score)]. In patient 2, the SB composite score was 76 (80 − 0 − 4, respectively). Conclusions: In this trifurcation approach, cervical cutaneous plexus provides a long complex nerve graft, which allows bridging the gap between proximal FN stump and several peripheral branches without great expenditure. In combination with the HFNT and ansa cervicalis transfer, this procedure enables the facial reanimation with low grade of synkinesis.},

To report a modification of the temporalis tendon transfer technique used in facial paralysis where dynamic adjacent muscle transfer is determined to be the best treatment option. Study design. Case series with chart review. Setting. Tertiary care teaching hospital. Subjects and Methods. Review of 10 consecutive patients who underwent orthodromic transfer of the temporalis tendon and the attached coronoid process for the treatment of long-standing facial paralysis. Outcomes measured included patient satisfaction, measurements of oral commissure elevation with smiling, and grading of preoperative and postoperative patient photographs by objective physician observers. Reporting of complications. Results. Patient satisfaction was high, with a mean score of 7.0 (possible score of 10). Four patients were graded by the observer as excellent to superb. The other 6 patients were rated as having fair to good postoperative results. Movement was identified in every patient and ranged from 2.1 to 9.3 mm, with mean movement of the oral commissure of 5.12 mm. One patient developed a seroma at the site of harvest of the fascia that was drained without further complication. Conclusions. This facial reanimation procedure is a novel modification of the temporalis tendon transfer technique in which the coronoid process is transferred in conjunction with the tendon. This technique is minimally invasive and may result in less variability of the postoperative aesthetic result. The procedure allows orthodromic action of the temporalis muscle, is relatively easy to perform, and eliminates the facial asymmetry typically produced by transfer of the origin of the temporalis muscle. © American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2011.},

	abstract = {Sex is likely to play an important part in reanimation of the face after paralysis, with women being superior in terms of resistance to neural injury and regeneration. Our aim was to evaluate the influence of the sex of the patient on the recovery of facial paralysis after surgical reanimation by comparing the degree of restored movement between men and women with long-standing paralysis that was reanimated by transfer of the hypoglossal nerve or cross-face nerve grafting. Between 1999 and 2010 we operated on 174 patients with facial paralysis. Of these we studied 26 cases (19 women and 7 men) with complete long-standing paralysis reanimated with either cross-face nerve grafting (n = 14) or transfer of the hemihypoglossal nerve (n = 12). The degree of movement restored was recorded in each case. Statistical analysis showed that in cases with long-standing paralysis women had significantly more movement restored than men for both cross-face nerve grafting (p = 0.02) and hypoglossal transposition (p = 0.04). We conclude that, after a neural injury, women tend to maintain the viability of the facial musculature longer than men, which suggests that they are more resistant to both denervation and the development of muscular atrophy. Whether this phenomenon can be explained by neural or muscular processes, or both, warrants further studies. © 2013 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.},

Thus, various attempts have been made to modify this method to reduce the tongue damage. The aim of this report was to present the results of hemihypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis (HHFA) technique in relation to facial muscles reanimation and hemitongue atrophy. Material and methods: The first 7 consecutive patients who underwent CN VII anastomosis with half of the CNXII, for which the follow-up period exceeded 12 months, were analysed. During the procedure, CN VII was transected as proximally as possible after drilling the mastoid process. CN XII was separated longitudinally into two parts at a short distance to allow suture of the stumps without any tension. One half of CN XII was transected and sutured to the distal stump of CN VII. Recovery from facial palsy was quantified with the House-Brackmann grading system (HB). Tongue function was assessed according to the scale proposed by Martins. Results: Features of initial reinnervation of facial muscles were visible after 6 months in all 7 patients. All patients achieved satisfactory outcome of CN VII regeneration (HB grade III) until the last control examination (12-27 months after surgery, mean 16). No or minimal tongue atrophy without deviation (grades I-II according to the Martins scale) was found in 4 patients. Mild hemiatrophy with tongue deviation {\textless} 30 degrees (grade III) was visible in 3 patients. Conclusions: In our experience, HHFA is effective treatment of facial palsy and gives a chance to reduce damage of the tongue.},

The lip reanimation outcome questionnaire is designed to assess these functional impairments after lip reanimation. Study Design: Cross-sectional validation study. Setting: Tertiary care academic center. Subjects and Methods: Patients who underwent lip reanimation and control subjects. A disease-specific instrument was created by systematic literature review and expert opinion. The 15-item patient completed subscale was administered to 20 lip reanimation patients. Photographs of 19 patients and three control subjects were taken in four poses and rated by six raters (2 surgeons, 2 residents, and 2 novices) by the use of a external rater subscale, and reliability was determined by the use of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Content and construct validity were assessed. Results: Internal consistency (ICC range 0.813-0.915 for each domain), test-retest reliability (ICC range 0.616-0.981 for each item) for the patient completed subscale, and interrater (ICC = 0.852) and interlevel reliability (ICC = 0.929) for the external rater subscale were substantial to excellent. The content validity index was 0.87. Construct validity was demonstrated by poorer scores in patients with transected nerves versus intact nerves for appearance (P = 0.04) and oral competence (P = 0.011). Photographs of control patients had lower asymmetry scores (P {\textless} 0.001), and the instrument detected greater asymmetry in patients with progressively more exaggerated smile (P {\textless} 0.001).

	abstract = {Introduction: The facial paralysis is a non-rare condition that has very disabling functional, morphological and psychological repercussions. The current gold standard in facial reanimation is revascularized re-innervated muscle transfers. Materials and methods: In this paper, we report the results of a new method using the gracilis flap with a double innervation on the masseter motor nerve and the controlateral facial nerve via a sural graft in a single stage intervention, on a series of six patients. Results: No failure was observed. The average delay of a voluntary contraction was 3.8. months, and 7.2. months for a spontaneous one. Three of the six patients had "excellent" results according to the Terzis and Noah classification, two were classified as "good" and one "average" Discussion: A choice is to be made between a method advocating a natural and spontaneous dynamicity (controlateral facial nerve stimulus) and a method focusing on the quality and quantity of contractions (ipsilateral trijeminal stimulus). In this new technique, we combine the two methods: a free gracilis transfer with a dual innervation on the healthy controlateral facial nerve via a sural graft, on one hand, and a second anastomosis on the ipsilateral masseter nerve, on the other hand.

Even weak movement is valuable and can be augmented with secondary static operations. Post-operative radiotherapy does not seem to affect the final outcome of facial function. Objectives: During radical parotidectomy, the sacrifice of the facial nerve results in severe disfigurement of the face. Data on the principles and outcome of facial nerve reconstruction and reanimation after radical parotidectomy are limited and no consensus exists on the best practice. Method: This study retrospectively reviewed all patients having undergone radical parotidectomy and immediate facial nerve reconstruction with a free, non-vascularized nerve graft at the Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland during the years 1990-2010.

	title = {Use of mini-temporalis transposition to improve free muscle outcomes for smile},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In managing late facial paralysis, association of cross-facial nerve grafting and free muscle transfer proves superior to any other method of mid-face reanimation. Nevertheless, predicting functional recovery remains a struggle, and in a minority of patients, results are deceiving. In this study, cases of fair or moderate outcomes from a free muscle transfer received a segmental temporalis transposition to upgrade the functional and aesthetic results. METHODS: From 1981 to 2007, 153 patients received a free muscle transfer for smile restoration in the authors' center. Of all patients, 72 percent (110 patients) required a third stage of revisions. In 41 cases, mini-temporalis transfer was used to augment moderate outcomes of a free muscle transfer. The exclusion criterion was less than 3 months' follow-up; thus, six patients were not evaluated. Each patient was videotaped at three successive time points (preoperatively, following free muscle transfer, and following mini-temporalis transfer). Five independent observers graded patients' videos using a five-category scale from poor to excellent. RESULTS: In all of the patients, the averaged scores were higher after free muscle transfer in comparison with the preoperative scores (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p {\textless} 0.0001). After mini-temporalis transfer, 97.1 percent of the patients had scores that were increased further and 2.8 percent had the same scores. Alopecia along the coronal incision was seen in four patients, and hollowing of the infratemporal fossa was seen in five. CONCLUSION: Analysis of these clinical data supports the use of mini-temporalis transfer as a safe and reliable method of correcting imperfect outcomes following a free muscle transfer for smile restoration. © 2008 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.},

	abstract = {Microvascular muscle transfer is the gold standard for reanimation following chronic facial nerve paralysis, however, despite the regenerative capacity of peripheral motor axons, poor reinnervation often results in sub-optimal function. We hypothesized that injection of alginate hydrogels releasing growth factors directly into donor tissue would promote reinnervation, muscle regeneration, and function. A murine model of sciatic nerve ligation and neurorrhaphy was first used to assess the ability of gel delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to promote functional reinnervation. VEGF + IGF-1 gel delivery to aged mice resulted in prolonged ability to control toe movement, increased toe spreading, and improved static sciatic index score, indicative of improved sciatic nerve and neuromuscular junction function. Further, a 26\% increase in muscle fiber area, and 2.8 and 3.0-fold increases in muscle contraction force and velocity, respectively, were found compared to blank alginate in the murine model. This strategy was subsequently tested in a rabbit model of craniofacial gracilis muscle transplantation. Electromyography demonstrated a 71\% increase in compound muscle action potential 9 weeks after transplantation following treatment with VEGF + IGF-1 alginate, compared to blank alginate in the rabbit model. Improving functional innervation in transplanted muscle via a hydrogel source of growth factors may enhance the therapeutic outcomes of facial palsy treatments and, more broadly, muscle transplantations.},

For the objective analysis, measurements of the distances between static and dynamic points in three-dimensional space were performed at rest and during smiling. The patients were assessed subjectively by non-professionals scoring videotapes. The range of motion of the oral commissure on smiling was 1.7 mm (0.8, mean and SE) after tendon and 5.5 mm (1.6) after microneurovascular transfer (P {\textless} 0.05) without showing teeth, and 0.6 mm (1.3) vs 3.6 mm (2.4, ns) with showing teeth. Compared with the healthy side, the excursions reached 6\% (16) after tendon and 71\% (26, P {\textless} 0.05) after microneurovascular transfer for smiling without, and -4\% (14) vs 19\% (14, ns) for smiling with showing teeth, respectively. Virtually no difference was found in the measurements at rest as well as in the subjective evaluation. Swelling of the cheek (28\%) and tethering of the skin (24\%) were shown to be the most disturbing symptoms after microneurovascular transfer. Better excursion and symmetry of the oral commissure were achieved by microneurovascular reconstruction for voluntary smile. However, the aesthetic outcome after microneurovascular transfer is markedly impaired by chronic complications including swelling of the cheek and tethering of the skin, which were not detected by the three-dimensional measurement technique used. We conclude that the aesthetic appearance should be considered equally important as the range of motion in the reanimated face.},

Introduced by Terzis in 1984, the technique can produce satisfactory to excellent results. In long-lasting paralysis, nonetheless, the babysitter procedure may need to be combined with a muscle(s) flap(s) for outcome upgrading, which was the focus of the present study. METHODS:: Thirty-eight patients had the babysitter procedure over a 20-year period (1984 to 2003). Twenty patients had only the babysitter procedure, whereas 18 needed an additional muscle flap(s) (up to three) to enhance function and cosmesis. These muscles included nine free (gracilis, pectoralis minor) and 20 regional (frontalis, minitemporalis, platysma, digastric) muscles for distinct target needs: eye closure, smile restoration, and lower lip depression. The need for a muscle flap was determined at the initial consultation. All free muscles were transferred at the second-stage of the babysitter procedure, whereas regional muscles were also transposed later. Three independent observers graded the results at two time intervals, preoperatively and 2 years after all operations were completed. RESULTS:: The average postoperative grading scores were significantly higher compared with preoperative scores for eye closure, smile, lower lip depression, and overall aesthetic outcome (p {\textless} 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed ranks test). All patients had upgrading of overall aesthetics and smile, whereas four maintained similar scoring for eye closure and one maintained similar scoring for lip depression. All but two had secondary procedures to further enhance facial symmetry. CONCLUSION:: The babysitter procedure in conjunction with muscle transfers in selected patients with late presentation can provide highly satisfactory results when seeking uncompromising outcome.

	abstract = {We present the case of a middle-aged gentleman who developed total bilateral irreversible peripheral facial palsy over a period of 10 years, starting with palsy of the marginal mandibular and buccal branches of the facial nerve and progressing to the zygomatic and temporal branches. The patient did not develop any other neurological symptoms, and all neurological and other tests have remained negative over the last 10 years. Dripping of saliva and inability to close the mouth necessitated reanimation of the perioral region with the help of a fascia lata graft fixed to the fascia of the masseter muscles. The increasing lagophthalmos and associated eye problems were alleviated with a temporal muscle transposition combined with a lengthening procedure using the temporal fascia, passed through the upper and lower eyelids and hooked around the medial canthal ligament. The fascia strips were sutured not to the canthal ligament itself, but to each other, thereby placing equal self-adjusted tension on the upper and lower eyelids. Both operations were successful and improved eating and eye closure functions, allowing resolution of the eye symptoms. Copyright © 2007 Muntaz B. Habal, MD.},

	title = {Development and validation of a computerized model of smiling: {Modeling} the percentage movement required for perception of smiling in unilateral facial nerve palsy},
	abstract = {Background: The inability to smile stands out as a notable difficulty for individuals with facial nerve palsies; a problem that facial reanimation surgery aims to rectify. However, smile reconstruction currently lacks quantitative data by which to objectively measure outcomes. This study aims to identify the relative importance of different oral muscles in terms of smiling, and explore the percentage function that needs to be restored for a smile to be perceived by an observer. Methods: A computer animation tool was developed to model the oral facial muscles and demonstrate the facial expressions produced by contraction of different muscle groups. By programming a variable unilateral paralysis of the zygomaticus major, the effects of 0-100\% function of this muscle can also be seen in a further set of animations using the basic muscular structure of a smile to produce a computerized proxy smile. These animations were shown to 75 adults from the general population who reported those expressions they perceived as a smile. Results: The only facial expression consistently associated with a perceived smile was caused by the combined contraction of the zygomaticus major and the levator anguli oris (P {\textless} 0.001). This concurs with previously reported observations of the human smile. Over 70\% of the subjects were able to perceive a smile with just 40\% function of the unilateral paralyzed zygomaticus major. Conclusions: These results present an objective target for facial reanimation surgery by which outcomes may be measured. This computerized model also provides a valuable tool for patient education during pre-operative consent. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

	title = {Detection and perceptual impact of side-to-side facial movement asymmetry},
	abstract = {IMPORTANCE In this study,we examined whether specific facialmovements have different time-delay detection thresholds, and to what extent such side-to-side facialmovement asymmetry affects subjective ratings ofmovement naturalness. Ratings of dynamic asymmetry in experimentally manipulated video recordings demonstrate that there are different side-to-side time-delay thresholds for distinct regions of the face, with a strong inverse correlation between naturalness rating and the length-of-time delay. These findings will be helpful for counseling patients with unilateral facial paralysis and guide the design of neural interfaces for facial reanimation. OBJECTIVE To determine the detection threshold of side-to-side facial movement timing asymmetry and measure its effect on perceived movement naturalness. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Videos of 5 symmetrical facial movements (eye blink, rapid eyebrow raising, slow eyebrow raising, smiling, and lip depression) were edited to introduce 6 levels of side-to-side timing asymmetry, ranging from 33 to 267 milliseconds. Participants (N = 58) viewed video clips through an online survey service, indicating whether they noticed side-to-side asymmetry and judgingmovement naturalness on a 5-point scale. RESULTS Therewas a significant difference among facialmovements in asymmetry detection threshold. Therewas a strong correlation between naturalness ratings and amount of delay acrossmovements (R = 0.823), with greater asymmetry being judged as progressively less natural. Blinkwas judged as less natural at 33, 67, 100, and 133 milliseconds of side-to-side delay compared with all othermovements (P {\textless} .005). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Side-to-side asymmetry in blink timing is detected sooner and viewed as less natural compared with asymmetry of the eyebrow and lips. At 100 milliseconds of delay, nearly all movements are detected as asymmetric, although blink is judged as the least natural. These findings will help set timing goals for facial pacing technologies treating unilateral paralysis. Copyright © 2013 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: The functions of the human face are not only of esthetic significance but also extend into metaphoric nuances of psychology. The loss of function of one or both facial nerves has a remarkable impact on patients' lives. Objective: To retrospectively analyze the functional outcomes of microneurovascular facial reanimation using masseteric innervation. Methods: Seventeen patients with irreparable facial paralysis resulting from benign lesions involving the facial nuclei (n = 14) or Möbius syndrome (n = 3) were treated with free muscle flaps for oral commissural reanimation using ipsilateral masseteric innervation and using temporalis muscle transfer for eyelid reanimation. Results were analyzed by the absolute commissural excursion and commissural excursion index and by a patient self-evaluation score. Presence of synkinesis was documented. Follow-up ranged from 8 to 48 months (mean, 26.4 months). Results: Normalization of the commissural excursion index was observed in 8 of 17 patients (47\%), an improvement was seen in 7 of 17 (41\%), and failure was observed in 2 of 17 (12\%). The individual dynamics of absolute commissural excursion and commissural excursion index changes are presented. A natural smiling response was observed in 10 of 17 patients (59\%) but not in the remaining 7 (41\%). This response reflected the patient's ability to relay the natural emotion of smiling through the masseteric nerve. Patients' self-evaluation scores were a level higher than objective indices. CONCLUSIONS: Innervation of free muscle flaps with the masseteric nerve for oral commissure reanimation might play an important role in patients with lesions of the facial nuclei (as in Möbius syndrome). Synkinesis persists for long periods after surgery. However, most of the patients learned to express their emotions by overcoming this phenomenon. Despite hypercorrection or inadequate correction, patients evaluated themselves favorably. © 2010 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.},

	abstract = {The present study was undertaken to evaluate the results of a group of patients following treatment for cerebellopontine angle lesions who developed postoperative facial palsy and underwent facial nerve repair in order to reanimate the muscles of facial expression. A retrospective study was performed on 23 patients treated between 1988 and 1997 at the 2nd and 4th ENT chairs of University "La Sapienza" of Rome for facial palsy following cerebellopontine angle surgery. Tumors included acoustic neuromas (n = 3). Seventeen patients underwent hypoglossal-facial anastomoses [10 with end-to-end anastomoses, 4 with May's interposition "jump-nerve" grafts and 3 with partial (30\%) use of the hypoglossal nerve plus a facial cross-over]. The remaining patients were operated on using a cable graft with the sural nerve (n = 2) and the great auricular nerve (n = 4). Postoperative facial function was determined by the House-Brackmann 6-scale classification. The hypoglossal-facial anastomoses resulted in long-term grade III or IV findings. Cable grafts improved facial function from grade VI to grade III. None of the patients operated on with the modfied VII-XII anastomosis developed swallowing disturbances. The ten patients having traditional hypoglossal-facial anastomoses showed different degrees of tongue disability and retention of residue in the oral cavity. Surgical recovery of postoperative facial palsy can be obtained with various techniques according to the availability of the proximal facial nerve stump at the brain stem. Since a traditional hypoglossal-facial anastomosis procedure can be a source of a separate disability for the patient, techniques are preferred that leave the hypoglossal nerve mostly intact and uncompromised.},

	abstract = {A study of the anatomy and transplantation of the musculus obliquus internus abdominis with a neurovascular pedicle transfer for facial reanimation in one stage is presented. Eleven adult cadavers (22 face sides) were dissected to observe the shape, thickness, innervation, and blood supply, of the musculus obliquus internus abdominis. The blood supply of this muscle primarily comes from the musculus obliquus internus abdominis branch of the deep circumflex iliac artery (diameter, 1.3 ± 0.2 mm), but it can also come from the eleventh intercostal artery (diameter, 1.14 ± 0.3 mm) and the infracostal artery (diameter, 1.5 ± 0.2 mm). The branch of the deep circumflex iliac artery and its vena comitans, or the infracostal artery and its vena comitans, could be anastomosed for muscle transplantation. The innervation of the musculus obliquus internus abdominis comes from the tenth and eleventh intercostal nerves (length, 12.7 ± 1.5 cm) and the infracostal nerve (length, 12.9 ± 1.3 cm). The eleventh intercostal nerve and the infracostal nerve were selected for anastomosis of muscle transplantation. From November of 1995 to November of 1999, 14 patients with long established facial paralysis were treated with transplantation of a musculus obliquus internus abdominis flap in one stage and were followed for 10 months to 6 years. In 13 patients, the dynamic functions of the transplanted muscles were restored, the obliqueness of the mouth and philtrum while static was corrected, and the facial muscle activities while smiling were harmonized. The eyelids of the paralyzed side could be closed postoperatively, indicating that the function of the orbicularis oculi of the paralyzed side was restored. The single-stage transplantation of a free musculus obliquus internus abdominis flap with one vascular, multi-nerve pedicle is a new method for facial reanimation in the treatment of long established facial paralysis. Because of the simplicity of the procedure and the completeness of the functional reanimation of the paralyzed facial muscles, compared with the results of other free muscle flap transfers, it is an ideal procedure for facial reanimation.},

	title = {Surgical results of the {Hypoglossal}-{Facial} nerve {Jump} {Graft} technique},
	abstract = {Background. The Hypoglossal-Facial nerve crossover has appeared as a surgical option for those scenarios where the facial nerve is injured in its intracranial course, but the conventional technique unequivocally leads to twelfth cranial nerve deficit. In recent years a number of different surgical approaches have been introduced with a view to avoiding the complete section of the hypoglossal nerve, such as the Jump Graft technique. This paper aims to present the results of the Hypoglossal-Facial nerve Jump Graft technique in relation to facial musculature reanimation capability and hemitongue function preservation. Methods. A retrospective analysis of the records of eight patients submitted to Hypoglossal-Facial nerve Jump Graft technique was performed. The surgical approach was characterised by the interposition of a short graft sutured to the distal stump of the transected facial nerve and sutured end-to-side to the hypoglossi, with cutting of only a third of the diameter of the latter. Findings. The facial nerve injuries were secondary to temporal bone trauma in five cases and to cerebellopontine angle tumour surgery in three. Grafts were harvested from the greater auricular nerve in six patients and from the sural nerve in two. The results of facial reanimation demonstrated facial symmetry and improvement in the facial tone in all cases, and classified as House-Brackmann grade IV in three (37.5\%) and grade III in five (62.5\%) patients. There was no incidence of definitive hemitongue atrophy and no patient complaint of swallowing or speech difficulty. Conclusions. The modification of the conventional technique of Hypoglossal-Facial nerve anastomosis by means of sectioning one third of the hypoglossal nerve area does not lead to dysfunction of this nerve and the surgical results in terms of facial reanimation are satisfactory. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Objective. The gracilis muscle free flap has become a reliable means for smile reanimation for patients with facial paralysis. Because it is a buried flap, it presents a postoperative monitoring challenge. We sought to evaluate our experience with color Doppler ultrasound in the monitoring of gracilis free flap viability in the immediate postoperative setting. Study Design. Case series with planned data collection. Setting. Tertiary medical center. Methods. Patients with facial paralysis treated with gracilis muscle free flap for smile reanimation performed between March 2009 and November 2010 were evaluated by color Doppler ultrasound and included in the study. Our experience with the use of the color Doppler ultrasound to monitor the gracilis muscle flap is presented. Results. Forty-six patients were identified. In all cases, color Doppler ultrasound was used postoperatively to assess flow through the vascular pedicle. Outcomes included an early flap survival rate of 100\%, with no instances of equivocal or absent flow on either the arterial or venous side. Color Doppler ultrasound provided important objective information regarding muscle perfusion postoperatively in several instances of equivocal postoperative perfusion of the flap. Conclusion. Color Doppler ultrasound is a safe, noninvasive method that can be performed serially to evaluate a buried free flap. We have had success in verifying normal arterial and venous flow through the pedicle using this method of monitoring of the gracilis muscle free flap during facial reanimation, and in 3 instances, it eliminated the need for wound exploration to verify appropriate muscle perfusion. © American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2012.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to describe the survival and volume of microneurovascular muscle flaps at different times after two-stage facial reanimation procedure by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to compare the functional outcome with MRI findings. Fifteen patients with a mean age of 36 years (range 7-63 years) operated on between 1988 and 1999 were available for this study. The muscles used for functional reconstruction were the latissimus dorsi (eight patients), gracilis (six patients) and serratus anterior (one patient). Hospital charts were reviewed and the clinical outcome of facial reanimation was graded on a scale from 1 to 6 according to House. The mean postoperative follow-up time was 7 years (range 3-14 years). Clinical grading and 1.5 T unit MRI of patients were performed concomitantly. The MR images were evaluated semi-quantitatively so that the muscle structure of the free flaps was graded on a scale from 1 to 4. The free flap area of each slice was defined and the volume of the free flap was calculated. Data were analysed statistically. The long-term functional outcome of the facial reanimation was regarded as good in 10 patients, which means they had only mild or moderate dysfunction of facial movements. In MR images, six free flaps displayed normal muscle structure, another six had a fatty appearance and two displayed severe muscle atrophy; in one patient the muscle tissue could not be identified. The volume of the free flap clearly declined in the course of the follow-up. A correlation was found between good functional outcome and normal muscle structure of the free flap in MRI, p=0.020. The longer the follow-up time after muscle transplantation the poorer the functional result. A similar correlation was found between abnormal muscle structure in MRI and a long follow-up time. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to assess the muscle structure of free microneurovascular flaps. Normal findings in MRI seem to correlate with a good clinical outcome in facial reanimation. A good functional result correlates with a shorter follow-up time and normal muscle structure in MRI. © 2004 The British Association of Plastic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The temporalis muscle has been the most popular. In the past one common problem was that the flap was not long enough to reach parts of the face distant from the affected area. To overcome this disadvantage, we have devised a flap consisting of the pedicled temporalis muscle, temporal fascia and galea together and have achieved good static results in paralyzed faces. From June, 1996 to May, 2003, we used this procedure with 38 longstanding facial paralysis patients (16 male and 22 female); 23 had right-sided and 15 had left-sided facial paralysis. The patients were followed-up over three years. Our results were recorded as "Excellent", "Good", "Fair" or "Poor". Excellent or good results were obtained in 33 patients (87\%). In these patients, the static results are very good. The oral commissure on the affected side maintained a favorable position and almost complete symmetry of expression was attained. We have acheived dynamic reconstruction by using a temporalis muscle-galea pedicled flap in 38 longstanding facial paralysis patients. Our results show that this is a good option in treating such patients.},

	abstract = {Reanimation of a spontaneous and synchronous smile, and sufficient depressor mechanism of the lower lip presents a surgical challenge in facial paralysis. Hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover and cross-facial nerve grafting are the best options if the mimetic muscles around the mouth are still viable in patients in whom the facial nerve was sacrificed at the brainstem. Although good muscle tone and facial motion have been obtained by hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover, smile is dependent on conscious tongue movement. Cross-facial nerve grafting provides a voluntary and emotion-driven smile, but requires two coaptation sites, which leads to substantial axonal loss and a long regeneration time. This method was not successful in activating the depressor mechanism. The first stage is the classic "baby-sitting" procedure, in which the bulk of the mimetic muscles was maintained by the rapid reinnervation of the hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover during the regeneration period of the cross-facial nerve graft, and temporalis muscle transfer to the eyelids is performed. During the second stage, the cross-facial nerve graft that used the thickest zygomaticobuccal branch on the healthy side was coapted with the corresponding branches on the paralyzed side. The hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover continued to innervate the depressor muscles. Good spontaneous smile and sufficient depressor mechanism were achieved by cross-facial nerve grafting and hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover respectively, and these techniques are demonstrated by the authors clinically and electrophysiologically.},

	abstract = {Facial paralysis in the midface causes loss of cheek tonus, asymmetry at rest, and inability to smile. Static suspension is generally performed in patients who cannot tolerate time-consuming dynamic reanimation. Current methods for static slings are overly simplistic. A sling, which is generally fascia lata or palmaris tendon, is placed between the modiolus and the zygomatic arch or the temporalis fascia, with further extension to the midline of the upper end lower lips in 1 vector. Recently, sutures are placed in a multivectorial approach, but suture failure via breakage is the main problem. In this study, the long, thin, and powerful plantaris tendon was used and divided into 3 slips. Placement of these slips and their tension adjustment were revised to provide strong and long-lasting upper lip and the modiolus pull, along with creation of a well-defined nasolabial fold, and to create sufficient cheek tonus. The first slip was positioned at 35 to 45 degrees to the horizontal plane between the modiolus and the upper preauricular area, second slip at 55 to 60 degrees between the upper lip and the deep temporal fascia, and the third slip at 0 to 10 degrees between the lower lip and lower preauricular area with gradually decreasing tension from above to below in 9 patients. Upper 2 slings were also sutured to the dermis of the nasolabial fold to define it optimally. Results were assessed both objectively and subjectively. Symmetry at rest, sufficient cheek tightness to prevent drooling, and a well-defined fold were obtained.},

	abstract = {Objective: One-stage free-flap facial reanimation may be accomplished by using a gracilis transfer innervated by the masseteric nerve, but this technique does not restore the patient's ability to smile spontaneously. By contrast, the transfer of the latissimus dorsi innervated by the contralateral facial nerve provides the correct nerve stimulus but is limited by variation in the quantity of contraction. The authors propose a new one-stage facial reanimation technique using dual innervation; a gracilis muscle flap is innervated by the masseteric nerve, and supplementary nerve input is provided by a cross-face sural nerve graft anastomosed to the contralateral facial nerve branch. Methods: Between October 2009 and March 2010, four patients affected by long-standing unilateral facial paralysis received gracilis muscle transfers innervated by both the masseteric nerve and the contralateral facial nerve. Results: All patients recovered voluntary and spontaneous smiling abilities. The recovery time to voluntary flap contraction was 3.8 months, and spontaneous flap contraction was achieved within 7.2 months after surgery. According to Terzis and Noah's five-stage classification of reanimation outcomes, two patients had excellent outcomes and two had good outcomes. Conclusions: In this preliminary study, the devised double-innervation technique allows to achieve a good grade of flap contraction as well as emotional smiling ability.

	abstract = {Background: Moebius syndrome, a rare congenital disorder of varying severity, involves multiple cranial nerves and is characterized predominantly by bilateral or unilateral paralysis of the facial and abducens nerves. The paralysis of the VI and VII cranial nerves leads to a lack of function in the muscles they supply. Facial paralysis often causes bilabial incompetence with speech difficulties, oral incompetence, problems with eating and drinking, including pocketing of food in the cheek and dribbling, as well as severe drooling. Methods: In this study, we report on pediatric patients with Moebius and Moebius-like syndromes seen and treated surgically from 2003 to September 2007 at the Operative Unit of Maxillofacial Surgery, Head and Neck Department, University of Parma, Italy. Results: Twelve patients underwent microsurgical reconstruction for restoration of facial movement. The contralateral facial nerve was used as a motor donor nerve in 4 procedures, the motor nerve to the masseter muscle was used in 8 patients, and the gracilis muscle was used in all operations, with a total of 17 free-muscle transplantations. All free-muscle transplantations survived transfer, and no flap was lost. We observed a significant improvement in drooling, drinking, speech, and facial animation with a high degree of patient satisfaction. Conclusions: The gracilis muscle free transfer is a surgical procedure well tolerated by the young patients and well accepted by their families. We consider it a safe and reliable technique for facial reanimation with good aesthetical and functional results in children with Moebius and Moebius-like syndromes. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The authors' goal was to develop a measurement system that is simple, uses commercially available equipment, takes little time, and provides meaningful and accurate measurements. This technique is called the facial reanimation measurement system. It involves placing dots around the patient's mouth and video recording the patient performing maximal effort smiles. Using a video editing program, one frame showing the patient at rest is overlaid with a second frame showing the patient's smile. This overlaid image is imported into Adobe PhotoShop, where measurements are obtained using tools available in the program. Twenty patients were used to test interrater and intrarater reliability of the facial reanimation measurement system. The accuracy of the measurement process was tested by comparing 10 known distances and angles with those obtained using the facial reanimation measurement system. Both intrarater and interrater reliability of the distance and angle measurements are highly accurate, with intraclass correlations greater than 0.9. The facial reanimation measurement system is accurate to within 0.6 mm and 2.0 degrees when compared with a "known" distance and angle. The facial reanimation measurement system has been used to measure smile movements of more than 200 patients and has been demonstrated to be valuable for detecting changes of facial movements over time. This system is simple and economical and only requires 20 minutes to perform. Although the authors demonstrated evaluation of smile movement, the system may be used to evaluate other movements, such as mouth puckering, eye closure, and forehead elevation.},

	abstract = {Hypoglossal-facial crossover is the most popular method of reconstructing the facial nerve in facial palsy resulting from proximal facial-nerve injury near the brainstem. Conventional hypoglossal-facial crossover involves performing a partial hypoglossal-nerve section or incision and an interpositional nerve graft to bridge the gap between the two nerves, which sometimes results in hemiglossal atrophy and its sequelae. Furthermore, the nerve graft may delay recovery and make facial reanimation weak. To solve these problems, we attempted to perform 'pure end-to-side anastomosis' (without section of the hypoglossal nerve) between the hypoglossal and facial nerves in four patients with facial palsy. In two patients (group I) a sural-nerve graft was used to bridge the gap between the two nerves. In the other two patients (group II) the intratemporal facial nerve was mobilised to the neck and one tension-free end-to-side anastomosis was performed. Facial symmetry and tone at rest were restored in all cases. Facial reanimation was achieved in group II after 8 months. Despite the small number of cases, we believe that the technique of hypoglossal-facial crossover with 'pure end-to-side anastomosis' and mobilisation of the intratemporal facial nerve can decrease donor-nerve morbidity in facial-nerve rehabilitation. © 2002 The British Association of Plastic Surgeons.},

	title = {Selective marginal mandibular neurectomy for treatment of the marginal mandibular lip deformity in patients with chronic unilateral facial palsies},
	abstract = {Background: For unilateral facial palsies, reanimation techniques such as cross-facial nerve grafting with free muscle transfer have been very successful at improving symmetrical lip elevation when smiling. However, these procedures do not address the residual asymmetry with respect to lip depression resulting from an uncorrected marginal mandibular nerve palsy. Techniques that do address this residual lip asymmetry have had variable results. Selective neurectomy of the unaffected marginal mandibular nerve has largely been abandoned as a treatment since it has been reported to result in severe oral functional and cosmetic deficiencies. The authors argue that selective marginal mandibular neurectomy is a reliable technique for treatment of the marginal mandibular lip deformity that does not compromise oral functionality. Methods: Thirteen patients with unilateral facial palsies underwent selective marginal mandibular neurectomy of the unaffected side; the procedure was performed by the principal investigator. These patients were then evaluated on the basis of symmetry with smiling and oral functionality. Twelve of the patients were contacted and questioned with a standardized questionnaire. Twelve of the patients were evaluated independently for symmetry with smiling using randomized preoperative and postoperative photographs. Results: Eleven of the 12 patients reported either improvement or no change in oral competence. Ten of the 12 patients reported either improvement or great improvement in symmetry with smiling. Improvement in symmetry with smiling was independently observed 77.2 percent of the time. Conclusion: These results support selective marginal mandibular neurectomy of the unaffected side in patients with unilateral facial palsies as a means of improving symmetry with smiling without compromising functionality.},

	abstract = {The two-stage method combining neurovascular free-muscle transfer with cross-face nerve grafting is now a widely accepted procedure for dynamic smile reconstruction in cases with long established unilateral facial paralysis. Although the results are promising, the two operations, about 1 year apart, exert an economic burden on the patients and require a lengthy period before obtaining results. Sequelae such as hypoesthesia, paresthesia, and conspicuous scar on the donor leg for harvesting a sural nerve graft also cannot be disregarded. To overcome such drawbacks of the two-stage method, we report a refined technique utilizing one-stage microvascular free transfer of the latissimus dorsi muscle. Its thoracodorsal nerve is crossed through the upper lip and sutured to the contralateral intact facial nerve branches. Reinnervation of the transferred muscle is established at a mean of 7 months postoperatively, which is faster than that of the two-stage method. In our present series with 24 patients, 21 patients (more than 87 percent) believed that their results were excellent or satisfactory, which also compares well with the results of the two-stage method combining free-muscle transfer with cross-face nerve graft.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:: The cross-facial nerve grafting/free-muscle transfer strategy for smile restoration is superior to static reconstruction or regional muscle transposition. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes of this technique in adult patients. METHODS:: Eighty-one adult patients received a free-muscle transfer for midface reanimation in the authors' center. Of this group, the authors identified 24 cases with follow-up of 5 years or longer. Smile symmetry and function were evaluated at three points: preoperatively, early postoperatively, and at long-term follow-up. To better evaluate the effect of time, patients were divided into groups according to the length of follow-up: group A, 5 to 6 years; group B, 7 to 10 years; group C, 11 to 15 years; and group D, more than 15 years. Four independent observers rated each patient's smile using a five-category scale ranging from poor to excellent. Panelists were asked to comment on whether the patient's smile weakened over time. RESULTS:: All patients obtained higher scores at 2 years from free-muscle transfer in comparison with their preoperative rates (p {\textless} 0.0001). Late outcomes demonstrated that muscle regeneration continues beyond the initial 2 years, with a further increase of the scores and motor units on electromyography at the late follow-up (p {\textless} 0.0001, p = 0.0313). No significance was found when comparing both variables among the four groups, indicating that time does not have a differential effect on muscle function. In 80 percent of the evaluations, the four observers agreed on maintained smile symmetry over time. CONCLUSIONS:: Cross-facial nerve grafting/free-muscle transfer is an effective technique for smile restoration in late facial paralysis. These data indicate maintenance of effective muscle function and progressive improvement with time. Copyright © 2009 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to evaluate retrospectively the results of experience with end-to-end anastomosis of cranial nerves VII and XII, performed due to transection of the facial nerve during acoustic neuroma removal.Methods: We assessed the facial reanimation results of 33 patients whose facial nerves had been transected during acoustic neuroma excision via a retrosigmoid approach, between 1985 and 2006, and who underwent end-to-end hypoglossofacial anastomosis. We compared the facial nerve functions of patients receiving short term (two to three years) and long term (more than three years) follow up, and we assessed any complications of the anastomosis.Results: A House-Brackmann grade III facial function was achieved in 46.2 and 86.4 per cent of the patients in the short and long term, respectively. HouseBrackmann grade IV facial function was achieved in 53.8 and 13.6 per cent of the patients in the short and long term, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the facial recovery results, comparing the short and long term follow-up periods (p=0.03). Disarticulation was the most common complication, seen in 19 (57.6 per cent) patients; numbness of the tongue was the next commonest (10 (30.3 per cent) patients). None of the patients developed dysphagia.Conclusion: Despite such morbidities as disarticulation and tongue numbness, end-to-end hypoglossofacial anastomosis is still an effective procedure for the surgical rehabilitation of static and dynamic facial nerve functions.

	abstract = {Background The present study demonstrates our experience with a novel use of the Platysma in facial reanimation, as a balancing procedure by counteracting an overactive free muscle transfer, and improving oral continence by re-establishing the oral sphincter mechanism. Material and methods Twelve patients, nine female (75\%) and three male (25\%), with a mean age of thirty-eight years (range: 2-66) are presented. Of these, in seven patients (58\%) who had excessive excursion of the free muscle, the contralateral pedicled platysma was transferred to counteract the excessive pull. Four patients (33\%) underwent bilateral platysma transfer for oral sphincter restoration, while one (8\%) had ipsilateral platysma transfer. Evaluation of aesthetic and functional results was performed by a panel of three independent observers, and the long term efficacy of the procedure was assessed through a patient questionnaire. Results All patients demonstrated significant upgrading of their oral competence associated with eating, drinking and smiling, as it was confirmed by the behavioural analysis (p {\textless} 0.01). Six of the ten patients that were available, responded to the Quality of Life Questionnaire. Five out of six were satisfied with their mouth appearance when they smile and five patients have a regular diet and without drooling. Conclusion A novel use of Platysma transposition is described that can substitute for a paralysed orbicularis oris muscle in restoring oral sphincter function or to counter balance an excessively active free muscle that was previously transferred for smile restoration. This novel Platysma transfer technique is intended to be used as an adjunct to other reanimation procedures. © 2013 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

	abstract = {Background and Purpose: Facial paralysis can have a significant negative impact on an individual's social, physical, and emotional well-being; however, little information has been reported on the efficacy of physical therapy interventions for this condition. The purpose of this case study was to describe the details of a physical therapy evaluation and intervention for a patient who underwent facial muscle transfer after resection of acoustic neuroma. Case Description: A 29-year-old woman underwent left-sided facial reanimation surgery, which included transplantation of the temporalis muscle and platysma muscle to the corner of the mouth. Intervention: The patient received 30 sessions of physical therapy that included electrical stimulation, biofeedback, lymphatic drainage, home exercises and facial stretching, and scar management. Outcomes: The patient exhibited an improvement in the Composite score of the Sunnybrook Facial Grading System from 17 to 41. She was able to regain function of the left side of her face with gains in expressions of smiling, frowning, and puckering, but symmetry was not completely restored. The patient had chronic difficulty with left-sided lymphedema, requiring frequent manual lymphatic drainage. Discussion: Data from this case study suggest that physical therapy management improves functional outcomes for individuals with postoperative changes in facial motor function from facial reanimation surgery. Further research is required to explore factors that influence the rate and extent of recovery derived from physical therapy interventions. Copyright © 2010 Neurology Section, APTA.},

	abstract = {Facial nerve repair is a dynamic reanimation technique. Direct nerve repair by suturing or grafting can provide good results within a specific time frame. Immediate nerve repair has been successful in cases of laceration injuries, but nerve grafting techniques are typically delayed when it is clear that direct suturing to the nerve trunk cannot be achieved without tension. Delayed nerve grafting is also employed following ablative procedures and in cases of trauma that cause segmental nerve deficits. Cross-facial nerve grafting is particularly useful when the peripheral branches are intact and the main trunk of the facial nerve is inaccessible. This method is also typically performed in a delayed fashion. Rehabilitation of the facial nerve and subsequent reinnervation of the mimetic motor endplates are achieved through axonal growth. In this article, we describe a consecutive series of five patients who developed facial paralysis following cranial surgery for acoustic neuroma. Each underwent successful cross-facial nerve grafting during the first week following their initial surgery. Each received a sural nerve graft to at least two main divisions of the VII(th) cranial nerve. We discuss our operative technique and the degree of restored nerve function.},

	title = {Modified retrograde approach to upper eyelid static loading},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Upper eyelid static weight loading is a technique commonly used to treat paralytic lagophthalmos. The traditional approach using the pretarsal crease incision leads to interruption of the anterior levator muscle fibers that attach to the face of the tarsus at its upper two thirds. This disruption can lead to permanent upper eyelid blepharoptosis. The retrograde approach avoids this problem but results in an incision at the lid margin, the dependent aspect of the weight. This increases the risk of implant extrusion. We hypothesize that a newly described modified retrograde approach is a safe and effective approach that avoids the pitfalls of previously described techniques. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. METHODS: Eight patients were evaluated with preoperative and 3 to 6 month postoperative photographs with the eyes in the open and closed positions for the degree of lagophthalmos and blepharoptosis present. Patients were also evaluated for development of complications such as implant extrusion, pain, or infection. The surgical technique uses a supratarsal skin crease incision, supramuscular dissection to the lid margin, entry into the tarsal plane at its inferior-most aspect, creation of a pocket for implant insertion, and layered closure. RESULTS: All patients had complete correction of lagophthalmos. No patients experienced infection, extrusion, or eye pain after surgery. All patients had less than 2-mm ptosis after surgery, with no patients experiencing any visual field disruption. CONCLUSIONS: The modified retrograde approach to upper eyelid static loading for paralytic lagophthalmos provides advantages over other techniques described. It is a safe, efficacious procedure, well tolerated by patients. © The American Laryngological, Rhinological \& Otological Society, Inc.},

	abstract = {When viable proximal facial nerve is inaccessible, facial nerve paralysis has been classically managed with the hypoglossal facial anastomosis (HFA) for at least the past 70 years. While this procedure has proven its reliability, its problems with hemilingual atrophy (speech deglutition, drooling, mastication), hypertonia, synkinesis, and mimetic deficits indicate the need for a more perfect solution for facial paralysis. The jump interpositional graft hypoglossal facial anastomosis (JIGHFA) along with gold weight lid implantation and electromyographic (EMG) rehabilitation achieves substantial facial reanimation without hemilingual deficits. We present our results in 18 patients who underwent JIGHFA along with gold weight lid implantation and EMG rehabilitation for facial paralysis. These results were compared with those from published series of 30 patients treated with HFA with EMG rehabilitation evaluated with objective (House-Brackmann) criteria. Anonymous retrospective information from questionnaires from 22 of 48 patients who were treated with the classic HFA was also presented. In properly selected patients, the JIGHFA technique is capable of achieving substantial facial reinnervation (House-Brackmann grade III or better) in 83.3\% of the patients without hemilingual sequelae which was seen in 45\% of the HFA patients. In contrast to the HFA, this procedure can be used by patients with concomitant lower cranial nerve paralysis (except hypoglossal), and bilateral facial paralysis. Hypertonia, synkinesis, and lagophthalmus were less symptomatic in the JIGHFA patients. Mimetic expression was not improved in the JIGHFA population compared with the HFA group.},

It is an automatic optical motion system that involves placing special reflecting dots on the subject's face and video recording with three infrared-light cameras the subject performing several face movements such as smile, mouth puckering, eye closure and forehead elevation. Images from the cameras are automatically processed with a software program that generates customised information such as 3D data on velocities and areas. The study has been performed in 20 healthy volunteers. The accuracy of the measurement process and the intrarater and interrater reliabilities have been evaluated. Comparison of a known distance and angle with those obtained by FACIAL CLIMA shows that this system is accurate to within 0.13 mm and 0.41°. In conclusion, the accuracy of the FACIAL CLIMA system for evaluation of facial movements is demonstrated and also the high intrarater and interrater reliability. It has advantages with respect to other systems that have been developed for evaluation of facial movements, such as short calibration time, short measuring time, easiness to use and it provides not only distances but also velocities and areas. Thus the FACIAL CLIMA system could be considered as an adequate tool to assess the outcome of facial paralysis reanimation surgery.

To salvage the muscle, we performed coaptation of the neural pedicle from the cross-facial nerve graft to the masseteric nerve.

No significant difference in the range of commissure excursion was observed between the healthy and operated sides.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Recoaptation of the neural pedicle from the cross-facial nerve graft to the masseteric nerve, leaving the muscle transplant in place, is a suitable salvage procedure after unsuccessful reconstruction with a cross-facial nerve graft, avoiding a second free muscle transfer.4.},

	title = {Serratus anterior in vivo contractile force study},
	abstract = {Background: A major limitation of functional muscle transfer for facial and intrinsic hand reanimation is the inability to predict the force that will be generated by the transplanted muscle. Methods: The authors studied the contractile force of the slips of the serratus anterior in situ in 10 patients and tested the gracilis muscle in four subjects as a control. Results: Mean contractile force generated by each serratus slip was 0.178 pound (range, 0.019 to 0.797 pound). This compares favorably with the maximum force generated by smiling (0.307 pound). Muscle strength correlated strongly with age (r = -0.805, p = 0.005). The lowest slip generated less force than those above it (0.133 pound versus 0.191 pound); this difference did not reach statistical significance. When the strength of the lowest slip is compared with the more superior slips as a percentage of total force generated by the slips (to compensate for the effect of age on muscle strength), the lowest slip was significantly weaker (18.6 percent of total force versus 25.5 percent of total force, p = 0.013). Mean contractile force generated by the gracilis was 0.963 pound, significantly different from that generated by a serratus anterior slip (p = 0.009). Conclusions: Each serratus slip could potentially be used to generate a separate force vector for facial reanimation. Further separation of the flap along preexisting fascial planes may allow generation of up to 10 independent force vectors, making the serratus anterior muscle flap an attractive option for facial reanimation and possibly intrinsic hand muscle reconstruction.},

These patients had undergone wide-field parotidectomy with facial nerve resection. Upper facial reanimation was accomplished with a proximal facial nerve-sural nerve graft, and lower facial movement was achieved through proximal facial nerve-long thoracic (serratus muscle) nerve anastomosis. Outcomes were determined by grading postoperative facial nerve function according to the House-Brackmann system. All 3 patients were able to close their eyes independent of lower facial movement, and all 3 had achieved House-Brackmann grade III function. We conclude that reanimating the paralyzed face with microvascular free-tissue transfer provides anatomic coverage and mimetic function after wide-field parotidectomy.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although the rate of reported facial nerve preservation after surgery for vestibular schwannomas continuously increases, facial nerve paresis or paralysis is a frequent postsurgical sequelae of major concern. The major goal of this study was to define criteria for the right indication, timing, and type of therapy for patients with palsies despite anatomic nerve continuity and those with loss of anatomic continuity. METHODS: One thousand vestibular schwannomas were surgically treated at the Department of Neurosurgery at Nordstadt Hospital from 1978 to 1993. Of 979 cases of complete removal and 21 cases of deliberately partial removal, the facial nerve was anatomically preserved in 929 cases (93\%). The rate of preservation is increasing, as is evidenced in the most recent cases, and preservation is supported by special electrophysiological monitoring. The facial nerve was anatomically severed in 60 cases (6\%). It was anatomically lost in previous operations that were performed elsewhere in 11 cases (1\%). In case of nerve discontinuity (42 cases), immediate nerve reconstruction by one of three available intracranial procedures (within the cerebellopontine angle, intracranial-intratemporal, intracranial-extracranial) was performed in the same surgical setting. In case of loss of the proximal facial nerve stump at the brain stem, early reanimation by combination with the hypoglossal nerve was achieved in most patients within weeks after tumor surgery. In a few patients with anatomic nerve continuity but absence of reinnervation for 10 to 12 months, a hypoglossal-facial combination was applied. All the patients with partial or with complete palsies were treated in a special follow-up program of regular controls and of modulation of physiotherapeutic treatment every 3 to 6 months. RESULTS: In intracranial nerve reconstruction at the cerebellopontine angle, 61 to 70\% of patients regained complete eye closure and an overall result equivalent to House-Brackmann Grade 3. Hypoglossal- facial reanimation led to Grade 3 in 79\%. The duration between the onset of paralysis and the reconstructive procedure is decisive for the quality of the outcome. These data are discussed in view of other treatment options and certain parameters influencing outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This management contains three major principles as follows: 1) preservation of facial nerve continuity in function by the aid of intraoperative monitoring, 2) early nerve reconstruction in case of lost continuity, and 3) scheduled follow-up program for all patients with incomplete or complete palsies.},

	abstract = {Introduction. For 100 years hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis (HFA) has been a common surgical procedure for reanimation of paralyzed mimic muscles of the face after axotomy of the facial nerve. However, the denervation and subsequent scarred degeneration of the target muscles of the hypoglossal nerve often results in unfavorable late effects for speech and swallowing. Therefore, the ansa cervicalis nervi hypoglossi-facial nerve anastomosis (ACH-FA) can be an alternative to avoid such late effects. As a branch of the hypoglossal nerve the ansa cervicalis innervates the infrahyoidal muscles. Neck dissection surgery proved that resection of the ansa cervicalis causes no side effects for swallowing beca use of several nerve anastomoses to the cervical plexus. Patients and method. We compared our clinical results of eight cases following a delayed ACHFA with our own experiences after HFA and results from the literature. Results. We found a reanimation rate lower than usually seen after HFA only in the target muscles of the forehead. This may be caused by a reduced neuronal plasticity of the ansa cervicalis. However, in the target muscles of the other two facial nerve branches we observed the same good results one would expect after HFA. There were no late side effects for swallowing and speech though.},

	title = {Complications of static facial suspensions with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene ({ePTFE})},
	abstract = {Background: Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) is a synthetic porous material that has been used for static suspension in facial paralysis. It is manufactured in thin (1-mm or 2-mm) sheets that can be cut into strips and implanted through keyhole facial incisions. Regional deformities are addressed by multiple suspensions that provide cosmetic and functional therapy. The use of ePTFE eliminates donor site morbidity associated with the traditional harvest of fascia from either the temporal area or fascia lata. However, properties unique to this alloplast contribute to the complications that have occurred after its use in facial reanimation. Objective: To describe complications with the use of ePTFE for facial suspension. Setting: Academic medical center. Method: Retrospective chart review and review of literature. Results: Six patients with facial paralysis who were treated with the EPTFE sling procedure had complications. Five slings failed because of stretch despite prestretching at implantation. One patient developed a late wound infection requiring removal of the sling. Conclusion: An ePTFE facial sling is an option for static facial suspension that can be therapeutic for patients with seventh nerve damage. There is a high rate of complications leading to revision surgery. Future studies are needed to evaluate alloplastic alternatives to ePTFE.},

	abstract = {Objectives/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcomes and complications associated with early gold weight implantation for management of the paralyzed eyelid. Study Design: A retrospective review of clinical charts was conducted to analyze results and complications in patients who underwent gold weight implantation within 30 days of onset of facial nerve paralysis and to compare these outcomes with those of patients who received gold weights after a traditional waiting period. Methods: The charts of 67 patients who underwent gold weight implantation during the time period of this study were reviewed. Patients were categorized into "early" or "late" groups based on whether gold weights were implanted before or after 30 days following onset of facial nerve paralysis. Etiology of facial nerve paralysis, degree of paralysis, timing of surgery, and outcomes of the procedure, including degree of lid closure and complication rates, were compared between the two groups. Results: Of the 67 patients, 49.3\% underwent gold weight implantation within 30 days of onset of paralysis and 50.7\% received gold weights after 30 days. A total of 89.2\% of all patients who underwent implantation in this study achieved satisfactory lid closure after the initial procedure. Both early and late implantation groups had statistically similar lid closure and complication rates. Conclusions: Implantation of gold weights within 30 days of paralysis is as effective for the management of paralytic lagophthalmos as delayed implantation and is not associated with higher complication rates. Early implantation of gold weights should be considered in all patients with paralytic lagophthalmos.},

	abstract = {Free transplant of gracilis muscle is the criterion-standard technique in dynamic rehabilitation of long-standing facial paralysis in which the facial musculature is atrophied. When the facial nerve is not available because of a bilateral lesion, other sources are the masseteric, hypoglossal, or accessory nerves. Although the use of hypoglossal nerve has been relegated to the background because of the morbidity caused by its loss, there are special situations in which the hypoglossal nerve should be considered the first option as donor motor nerve. The present article discusses the case of a patient with dynamic reanimation of bilateral facial paralysis with free-muscle transfer neurotized to the hypoglossal nerve. End-to-side coaptation of gracilis motor nerve and hypoglossal motor nerve allows neurotization of the transplanted muscle with minimum repercussion in speech or swallowing and can provide an adequate spontaneous smile with time.

	title = {Quantitative facial motion analysis after functional free muscle reanimation procedures},
	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the success of functional free muscle transfer in patients with chronic facial paralysis using a recently developed quantitative method known as the maximum static response assay of facial motion. A retrospective review of a single surgeon series of six patients with longstanding facial paralysis was performed. The maximum static response assay was performed on all patients preoperatively and serially during the postoperative period. Twenty-seven patients (54 sides) with normal facial function were also evaluated and served as controls. The contralateral normal side in those patients with unilateral facial paralysis (n = 4) also served as a control. Movement of the modiolus during smile was recorded in the x axis and y axis. To determine net smile movement, the vector of movement was calculated by means of the Pythagorean theorem. Vectors were then defined mathematically by calculating direction and magnitude. The average direction of the vector during smile for the normal control population was 58.3°(range 32.5 to 83.1°) from the horizontal through the modioli, and the average magnitude was 10.6 mm (range 4.2 to 20.1 mm). The average preoperative direction for the reanimated sides was 176.8°with a range of 83.3 to 225°. Patients with bilateral paralysis (n = 2) were excluded for calculation of the vectors on the normal contralateral side. The average preoperative direction for the normal contralateral side in patients with facial paralysis was 58.3°with a range of 48.2 to 68.4°. Postoperatively, the average direction of the vector during smile for the reanimated sides improved to a value of 77.6°with a range of 45.7 to 113.8°. The average change in direction of the preoperative reanimated side compared with the postoperative reanimated side was significant (p = 0.01). Postoperatively, the average direction of the vector for the contralateral normal sides was 43°with a range of 11 to 57.2°. The change in direction for the contralateral normal side was not significant (p = 0.18). The average magnitude of the reanimated side improved from a non-anatomic 2.8 mm preoperatively (range 0.8 to 6.8 mm) to an anatomic 4.9 mm postoperatively (p = 0.02). The contralateral normal side magnitude decreased from 9.4 mm (range 7.3 to 11.6 mm) preoperatively to 5.7 mm (range 3.8 to 7.7 mm) postoperatively (p = 0.006). More specifically, the absolute change in movement on the reanimated side during smile for the x axis and y axis was 2.3 mm (p = 0.05) and 4.0 mm (p = 0.002), respectively. This corresponded to an absolute change in the magnitude of the vector of 4.6 mm in an anatomic direction, on the contralateral side the absolute change in magnitude during smile from preoperative to postoperative for the x axis and y axis decreased by 1.5 mm (p = 0.13) and 5.3 mm (p = 0.05), respectively. This reflected an absolute change in the magnitude of the vector of 5.5 mm. Functional free muscle transfer in patients with chronic facial paralysis resulted in anatomic recovery of motion in the majority of patients in this series. The maximum static response assay can be used to objectively assess the results of facial reanimation.},

	abstract = {Paralysis of the frontalis muscle is extremely difficult to reverse. The best treatment for facial paralysis reanimation which preserves spontaneity and muscle specificity is end-to-end neurorrhaphy through cross-face nerve grafting. However, it is rarely possible. Muscle-nerve-muscle (MNM) neurotization consists of an interposition of a nerve graft connecting the normal muscle to the denervated muscle. The axons of the muscle with intact innervation grow inside a neural graft towards the paralyzed muscle resulting in neurotization. The purpose of this report is to present a case of frontalis muscle paralysis reanimated by MNM neurotization. A 65-year-old female patient presented complete facial paralysis after temporomandibular joint surgery. Five months afterwards, the patient spontaneously recovered facial muscle movements except the frontalis muscle. Definitive paralysis of the frontalis muscle was diagnosed after 11 months, and MNM neurotization was chosen and performed. Three strings of sural nerve were placed in separated tunnels in the subcutaneous plane, through small skin incisions to connect the two bellies of frontalis muscle bilaterally, and then sutured into the muscle pocket of each side. The patient presented voluntary and synchronic contraction of the bilateral frontalis muscle, 4 months after neurotization. Electroneuromyography confirmed muscle contraction by contralateral stimulation. Despite its efficacy still being researched, it is a very promising technique for the reanimation of small muscles in facial paralysis.},

In this study, we use a computer-animated 3D facial tool to investigate how dynamic properties of a smile are perceived. We created smile animations where we systematically manipulated the smile's angle, extent, dental show, and dynamic symmetry. Then we asked a diverse sample of 802 participants to rate the smiles in terms of their effectiveness, genuineness, pleasantness, and perceived emotional intent. We define a "successful smile" as one that is rated effective, genuine, and pleasant in the colloquial sense of these words. We found that a successful smile can be expressed via a variety of different spatiotemporal trajectories, involving an intricate balance of mouth angle, smile extent, and dental show combined with dynamic symmetry. These findings have broad applications in a variety of areas, such as facial reanimation surgery, rehabilitation, computer graphics, and psychology.},

	title = {Uses of the superficial temporal fascial flap in facial paralysis},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The superficial temporal fascia merits its popularity in reconstructive surgery for its large number of clinical applications. In this report, the authors present their experience with different uses of the superficial temporal fascial flap in facial reanimation. METHODS: Seventeen cases are presented. In 10 patients, the fascial flap provided a vascularized lining at the interface between the free muscle flap for smile restoration and the overlying skin. In six cases, it was utilized to correct small or moderate contour deficits in the paretic hemiface, using either the fascial flap alone or in combination with free adipose tissue. One patient presented with facial paralysis and Frey syndrome following parotidectomy, and the fascial flap was used to control gustatory sweating. Five independent observers graded aesthetic and functional outcomes on a scale from poor to excellent. Three patients were lost to follow-up, so 14 cases were evaluated. RESULTS: Follow-up ranged from 1 to 216 months (47 ± 60.49 months). The specific reconstructive goal for each patient was achieved and the overall symmetry was greatly improved, with all patients being granted higher scores by the panel of observers following the superficial fascia flap (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed ranks, p {\textless} 0.0001). Transient or permanent alopecia along the temporal incision was the main complication observed. CONCLUSIONS: Transfer of the superficial temporal fascia flap is a valuable technique with several potential applications in facial paralysis management and reconstructive surgery in general. The advantages of this highly vascularized, gliding, and pliable flap far outweigh the associated minimal complications. © 2008 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.},

	title = {Single-stage facial reanimation in the surgical treatment of unilateral established facial paralysis},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of unilateral long-standing facial paralysis requires transposition of new musculature to restore the function of the atrophied mimetic musculature. Facial reanimation with free neuromuscular flaps is actually the accepted standard treatment. Two-stage procedures have been used for years, with a total flap recovery time of 18 to 24 months. In 1998, Harii proposed single-stage facial reanimation using the latissimus dorsi flap, showing a faster recovery compared with two-stage procedures. The present study evaluated the results of the authors' center applying the single-stage facial reanimation. METHODS: From April of 1999 to April of 2006, 33 patients with unilateral established facial paralysis underwent single-stage facial reanimation via latissimus dorsi free flap transplantation. Time from the onset of paralysis ranged from 20 months to 64 years (mean, 11.6 years). Patients were followed postoperatively for at least 24 months. Results were studied and compared using Terzis and Noah's 1997 classification. RESULTS: Among the 33 patients included in the study, there was an average reinnervation time of 8.9 months. According to Terzis and Noah's classification system, 12 patients (36.3 percent) were considered grade V, 12 (36.3 percent) were grade IV, four (12.2 percent) were grade III, two (6.1 percent) were grade II, and three (9.1 percent) were grade I. CONCLUSIONS: Single-stage facial reanimation with a latissimus dorsi flap achieved morphofunctional results similar to those obtained with the classic two-stage technique. In addition, the authors were able to reduce the morbidity associated with treatment and the time required for recovery. © 2009 American Society of Plastic Surgeons.},

When bilateral paralysis and paresis preclude use of the contralateral facial nerve, the authors' preferred donor nerve for reinnervation of free muscle transfer is a branch of the trigeminal nerve, the ipsilateral nerve to the masseter. Methods: The authors have used a branch of the trigeminal nerve as a donor for three children with Möbius syndrome. Results: Of three children with Möbius syndrome, two are now able to smile independently of jaw closure. One child is now 2.6 years past bilateral free gracilis transfers completed at age 13.2 years. The second child is 8.2 years past free gracilis transfer to the left side of the face performed at age 7.6 years. The third child is 5.6 years past bilateral facial reanimation with free latissimus and free gracilis flaps completed at age 13.4 years. This child is notable to smile independently of jaw closure. The two who are able to smile independently of jaw closure demonstrated maximum excursion of the lateral commissure on the affected sides when asked to smile without biting; however, they demonstrated minimal excursion of the lateral commissure on the affected sides when asked to bite without trying to smile. Conclusions: These findings indicate that smiling independently of jaw closure is attainable with reanimation to the masseteric branch, refuting previous speculations. Early age at operation and absence of complete bilateral paralysis in these two children may have contributed to cortical adaptation to smiling.},

Setting: University-based tertiary referral center. Patients: Between 1976 and 2000, rehabilitative facial nerve surgery was performed on 70 adult patients with varying underlying diseases. Intervention: Three methods of facial nerve rehabilitative surgery were performed: end-to-end anastomosis, cable nerve graft interposition, and classic faciohypoglossal transposition. Main Outcome Measures: The House-Brackmann grade was scored at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months by the two senior authors. A favorable outcome was defined as House-Brackmann Grade ≤ III. Other parameters recorded were repair technique, age, nerve rerouting, whether the repair was immediate or delayed, and the anatomic position of the nerve defect in relation to the geniculate ganglion. Results: Data were available on 66 patients (94\%), of whom 13 had an end-to-end anastomosis, 25 a cable nerve graft interposition, and 28 a classic faciohypoglossal transposition. At 24 months, a House-Brackmann Grade ≤ III was achieved in 84.6\% of those who underwent end-to-end anastomosis, 56.0\% of those who underwent cable nerve graft interposition, and 25.0\% of those who underwent classical faciohypoglossal transposition. End-to-end anastomosis and cable nerve graft interposition were superior to classic faciohypoglossal transposition (log-rank test, p = 0.0013). Twenty-five percent of all cases demonstrated improvement in House-Brackmann grade after 24 months. Increasing age at the time of repair was associated with a poorer outcome (p = 0.03 on logistic regression). Conclusion: End-to-end anastomosis confers the best facial function, followed by cable nerve graft interposition and then classic faciohypoglossal transposition. Contrary to some previous opinions, improvement in facial function can still occur 2 years after surgical repair, particularly with classic faciohypoglossal transposition. © 2005, Otology \& Neurotology, Inc.},

	abstract = {Objectives/Hypothesis To quantify the threshold for human perception of asymmetry for eyebrow elevation, eye closure, and smile, and to ascertain whether asymmetry detection thresholds and perceived severity of asymmetry differ in distinct facial zones. Study Design Online survey. Methods Photographs of a female volunteer performing eyebrow elevation, eye closure, and smile were digitally manipulated to introduce left-to-right asymmetry in 1-mm increments from 0 mm to 6 mm. One hundred and forty-five participants viewed these photographs using an online survey, measuring accuracy of asymmetry detection and perceived expression unnaturalness (on a scale of 1-5). Results Photographs of facial asymmetries were correctly judged as asymmetrical over 90\% of the time for 2 mm or more of asymmetry in eyelid closure, and 3 mm or more of asymmetry during smiling. Identification of eyebrow elevation asymmetry gradually rose from 23\% correct to 97\% correct across the range of 1 mm to 6 mm of asymmetry. Greater degrees of asymmetry were ranked as significantly more unnatural across all expressions (3 tests; X(2) (6, N = 145) = 405.52 to 656.27, all P {\textless}0.001). Conclusion Thresholds for asymmetry detection vary across different zones of the face; once detected, asymmetry in eyelid position is perceived as more unnatural than asymmetries in either brow elevation or smile. These data will inform counseling of patients with segmental facial weakness and may provide more objective goals for facial reanimation procedures. Level of Evidence 4.

	abstract = {Object. The authors have developed a technique for the treatment of facial paralysis that utilizes anastomosis of the split hypoglossal and facial nerve. Here, they document improvements in the procedure and experimental evidence supporting the approach. Methods. They analyzed outcomes in 36 patients who underwent the procedure, all of whom had suffered from facial paralysis following the removal of large vestibular schwannomas. The average period of paralysis was 6.2 months. The authors used 5 different variations of a procedure for selecting the split nerve, including evaluation of the split nerve using recordings of evoked potentials in the tongue. Results. Successful facial reanimation was achieved in 16 of 17 patients using the cephalad side of the split hypoglossal nerve and in 15 of 15 patients using the caudal side. The single unsuccessful case using the cephalad side of the split nerve resulted from severe infection of the cheek. Procedures using the ansa cervicalis branch yielded poor success rates (2 of 4 cases). Some tongue atrophy was observed in all variants of the procedure, with 17 cases of minimal atrophy and 14 cases of moderate atrophy. No procedure led to severe atrophy causing functional deficits of the tongue. Conclusions. The split hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis procedure consistently leads to good facial reanimation, and the use of either half of the split hypoglossal nerve results in facial reanimation and moderate tongue atrophy. ©AANS, 2013.},

	abstract = {Background: Hypoglossal nerve injury may result in swallowing and speech problems. To reduce this morbidity and allow the performance of the hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis bilaterally, a technique that includes partial splitting of the hypoglossal nerve and skeletonization of the facial nerve within the mastoid process has been applied. The aim of this study is to present clinical results regarding the facial and hypoglossal nerves after the procedure. Methods: Prospectively collected data from 56 consecutive patients who underwent hemihypoglossal−facial nerve anastomosis (HHFA) were analyzed. The outcome was correlated with epidemiologic data, initial disease, the presence of neurofibromatosis type 2, previous radiosurgery, and the time between nerve injury and reconstructive surgery. Results: Forty-eight (84\%) patients achieved satisfactory outcomes; 8 of them (14\%) showed some improvement, and in 1 patient (2\%) there was no improvement during long-term observation. The result at follow-up was not related to the time interval between the 2 procedures. However, recovery times for facial tonicity were statistically significantly longer if the procedure was performed after 12 months (P = 0.044). There was no statistically significant association between patient age (P = 0.96) or sex (P = 0.13) and facial nerve function. HHFA resulted in no or minimal tongue atrophy without deviation in 53 patients (93\%), and the remainder had mild hemiatrophy with tongue deviation {\textless}30 degrees. Conclusions: HHFA is an effective technique for facial nerve reanimation with acceptable morbidity related to tongue function. Patients with a longer duration of facial palsy still have a good chance for restoration of facial movement but require longer recovery periods.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the Glasgow Facial Palsy Scale as a tool to assess facial reanimation surgery in facial palsy. Software analysis of digital video data is used to measure facial movements, comparing the affected to the normal side. We present the first use of the Glasgow Facial Palsy Scale following facial re-animation surgery. Design: A comparison of the Glasgow Facial Palsy Scale against the Nottingham scoring system. Subjects undergoing unilateral surgical smile reanimation procedures were selected. Comparison was made with the Nottingham facial palsy scale and the House-Brackmann Scale pre- and postoperatively. Setting: Patients were recruited in the facial palsy clinic of Canniesburn Plastic Surgery Unit, Glasgow. Participants: Seven consecutive patients were selected who were due to undergo unilateral facial reanimation. Main outcome measures: The difference in pre- and post-surgical facial movement as measured using the Glasgow Facial Palsy Scale with this value being compared to that obtained using the Nottingham scoring system. Note was also taken of the correlation with House-Brackmann system and clinical correlation. Results and Conclusions: Statistical analysis indicated a linear relationship between the Glasgow Facial Palsy Scale and the Nottingham System. The Pearson correlation test was used to confirm the relationship between the two methods giving a result of -0.587, which indicates significant correlation between the two methods. We conclude that the Glasgow Facial Palsy Scale is a standardised objective method of assessing the change in facial movement following smile reanimation surgery. We commend it as a useful tool to objectively assess surgical results in this challenging field. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

In grafted nonvascularized nerve, density of vascular structures (also clearly immunopositive for VEGF and both receptors) showed a mean of 166 vessels (range 78 to 267) per unit area, corresponding to control values. In addition, VEGF was expressed in axons and perineural structures. In control samples, VEGF expression was low and occurred in the myelin sheath. In nerve grafts, expression of Flt-1 and Flk-1 (less intense) was seen in axons and perineural structures. A higher density of vessels was associated with lower VEGF expression (not significant).

	title = {Facial reanimation by staged, split masseter muscle transfer},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Facial paralysis of the lower face presents severe functional and aesthetic disturbance to patients. The gamut of facial paralysis correction is diverse and must be tailored to the patient. When nerve repair or free functional muscle transfer is unavailable, regional muscle transfer has become a staple in surgical management of facial paralysis. Previous masseter transfers relied on orbicularis oris attachment, which may be atrophic, adhered, or lengthened. Using fascia lata grafts, we describe the senior author's method of staged, split masseter transfer as a reliable method for reanimating the lower third of the face in appropriate candidates.METHODS: The staged, split masseter muscle transfer is a 3-part repair. The first stage places a hemioral fascia lata graft to act as an anchor reinforcement. The second stage transfers the split masseter muscle, suturing to the fascia lata reinforced oral commissure. The third stage, a reefing procedure, is performed 6 to 10 months later under local anesthesia to reinforce attachments.RESULTS: Six patients underwent the staged, split masseter muscle transfer. Mean age was 43 (15-67) years. Mean time to surgery from onset of deficit was 174 months (3 months to 65 years). All patients had significant improvement over preoperative symptoms. Symmetry was restored in repose. On movement, commissure excursion went from 0 to 6.67 mm in the superolateral vector. Of the 6 patients, 5 required an average of 1.5 outpatient revisions to achieve satisfactory results on average of 4.67 (4-127) months after the final stage.CONCLUSIONS: The staged, split masseter transfer is useful for restoring subtle reanimation in patients presenting with facial paralysis. The staged, split masseter transfer provides bulk and restores both static and dynamic function. We present a case series demonstrating excellent long-term functional results.},

	title = {Masseteric-facial nerve anastomosis for early facial reanimation},
	abstract = {Objective: Early repair of facial nerve paralysis when cortical neural input cannot be provided by the facial nerve nucleus, is generally accomplished anastomozing the extracranial stump of the facial nerve to a motor donor nerve. That is generally the hypoglossus, which carries a variable degree of morbidity. The present work aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the masseteric nerve as donor for early facial reanimation, with the advantage that harvesting is associated with negligible morbidity. Methods: Between October 2007 and August 2009, 7 patients (2 males, 5 women) with unilateral facial paralysis underwent a masseter-facial nerves anastomosis with an interpositional nerve graft of the great auricular nerve. The interval between the onset of paralysis and surgery ranged from 8 to 48 months (mean 19.2 months). All patients included in the study had signs of facial mimetic muscle fibrillations on electromyography. The degree of preoperative facial nerve dysfunction was grade VI following the House-Brackmann scale for all patients. Results: At the time of the study, all the patients with a minimum follow-up time of 12 months after the onset of mimetic function had recovered facial animation. Facial muscles showed signs of recovery within 2-9 months, mean 4.8 months, with the restoration of facial symmetry at rest. Facial movements appeared while the patients activated their chewing musculature. Morbidity related to this intervention is only the loss of sensitivity of earlobe and preauricular region. Conclusion: The present technique seems to be a valid alternative to classical hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis because of similar facial nerve recovery and lower morbidity. © 2011 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.},

	title = {A new technique for hypoglossal-facial nerve repair},
	abstract = {Hypoglossal reinnervation of the facial nerve may be required after a proximal facial nerve injury. The classic hypoglossal-facial graft procedure involves transection of the donor hypoglossal nerve, resulting in hemiglottic paralysis that, in association with paralysis of other cranial nerves, may cause speech and swallowing difficulties. Multiple lower cranial nerve palsies in conjunction with facial paralysis, as may occur after procedures such as skull base surgery, contraindicate the use of such techniques. The successful use of XII-VII 'interposition jump grafts' without hemiglossal weakness has been described. However, a prolonged recovery period and weaker facial reanimation have been seen. In order to attain maximum facial reinnervation while preserving hypoglossal function, we have developed a new technique of XII-VII repair. This method involves mobilization of the intratemporal portion of the facial nerve remnant, achieving a single anastomosis with the hypoglossal nerve, which has been partially incised. This technique has been used in three patients to date, with 6 to 11 months follow-up. In all cases facial tone and symmetry have been restored and voluntary facial expression accomplished. The authors conclude that by employing the techniques described highly satisfactory cosmetic and functional results may be expected, without compromising hypoglossal nerve function.},

	abstract = {The single-stage technique for cross-face reanimation of the paralyzed face without nerve graft is an improvement over the two-stage procedure because it results in early reinnervation of the transferred muscle and shortens the period of rehabilitation. On the basis of an anatomic investigation, the short head of the biceps femoris muscle with attached lateral intermuscular septum of the thigh was identified as a new candidate for microneurovascular free muscle transfer. The authors performed one-stage transfer of the short head of the biceps femoris muscle with a long motor nerve for reanimation of established facial paralysis in seven patients. The dominant nutrient vessels of the short head were the profunda perforators (second or third) in six patients and the direct branches from the popliteal vessels in one patient. The recipient vessels were the facial vessels in all cases. The length of the motor nerve of the short head ranged from 10 to 16 cm, and it was sutured directly to several zygomatic and buccal branches of the contralateral facial nerve in six patients. One patient required an interpositional nerve graft of 3 cm to reach the suitable facial nerve branches on the intact side. The period required for initial voluntary movement of the transferred muscles ranged from 4 to 10 months after the procedures. The period of postoperative follow-up ranged from 5 to 42 months. Transfer of the vascularized innervated short head of the biceps femoris muscle is thought to be an alternative for one-stage reconstruction of the paralyzed face because of the reliable vascular anatomy of the muscle and because it allows two teams to operate together without the need to reposition the patient. The nerve to the short head of the biceps femoris enters the side opposite the vascular pedicle of the muscle belly, and this unique relationship between the vascular pedicle and the motor nerve is anatomically suitable for one-stage reconstruction of the paralyzed face. As much as to 16 cm of the nerve can be harvested, and the nerve is long enough to reach the contralateral intact facial nerve in almost all cases. The lateral intermuscular septum, which is attached to the short head, provides "anchor/suture-bearing" tissue, allowing reliable fixations to the zygoma and the upper and lower lips to be achieved. In addition, the scar and deformity of the donor site are acceptable, and loss of this muscle does not result in donor-site dysfunction.},

Seven months later the first signs of reinnervation of the facial muscles were noticed. Two and a half years after surgery, CN VII function was assessed as grade II/III according to the House-Brackmann scale. The authors emphasize the significance of immediate repair of CN VII in modern skull base surgery but also the importance of a patient's self-training to obtain the best functional outcome of the facial reanimation. Reconstruction using the great auricular nerve has two significant advantages: first, the patient avoids further procedures for nerve repair, and second, the harvested nerve is located in direct proximity to the operation area.},

Lagophthalmos, or poor eyelid closure, and loss of blink secondary to lack of nerve supply to the orbicularis oculi, can lead to exposure keratopathy, corneal breakdown, ulcers, and even perforation. Management of patients should be directed toward the severity of ocular findings and ranges from supportive care to surgical reanimation and soft tissue repositioning. Patients with facial nerve palsy who present at earlier stages can benefit from conservative treatment. Use of temporary external eyelid weights can help restore a functional blink mechanism and prevent corneal decompensation. Case report: A 29-year-old patient with lagophthalmos secondary to left facial nerve palsy after surgical excision of an acoustic neuroma was treated with a temporary external eyelid weight. Conclusion: Temporary external eyelid weights are part of the armamentarium in the supportive care of patients with lagophthalmos and exposure keratopathy secondary to facial nerve palsy.

	abstract = {Background: Synchronicity of the oral commissure movement of a bilateral smile is a significant goal for reconstruction in facial reanimation and may only be guaranteed with use of the facial nerve as a donor nerve. Yet over the years several studies report some degree of spontaneity in certain patients when using a non-facial donor nerve, which indicates that synchronous initiation of the smile might be achievable with other donor nerves. We designed a prospective cohort study to evaluate whether pre-operative involuntary activation of the masseteric nerve during smile predicts development of a synchronous smile development when using the masseteric nerve for reanimation. Methods: In a prospective cohort study unilateral long-standing facial palsy patients scheduled for dynamic smile reanimation with a free functional muscle transplant using the masseteric nerve as a donor nerve were preoperatively evaluated via EMG for involuntary activation of the masseter muscle upon smiling, which we called coactivation. Postoperatively, six months after noting the first muscle contraction smile synchronicity was evaluated. We analyzed the synchronicity of the bilateral smile development by analyzing slow-motion video sequences of the patients that were taken while the patients were watching funny video sequences. Results were then correlated with the pre-operative EMG. Results: 30 patients were recruited for this prospective study and underwent facial reanimation surgery with a free gracilis transfer innervated by the masseteric nerve. 19 patients demonstrated involuntary coactivation of the masseter muscle upon smiling and 11 did not. Postoperatively all patients could demonstrate a voluntary smile. 94\% of patients who had preoperative coactivation showed a synchronous movement of the oral commissure when smiling. In those patients, that did not show activation of the masseter muscle upon smiling 0\% showed synchronicity. The preoperative coactivation of the masseter muscle is able to predict the outcome regarding synchronicity of the smile with a sensitivity of 99.7\%, a specificity of 88.5\% and 92.5\% positive predictive value and 99.6\% negative predictive value (p {\textless} 0.001 for all). Conclusions: The lack of masseter co-activation with smile predicts a lack of spontaneous involuntary smile after dynamic smile reconstruction using the masseteric nerve.},

A free latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap was transferred to the defect, with the thoracodorsal nerve coapted to an ipsilateral, severed buccal branch of the facial nerve. Postoperatively, the flap survived completely, with its skin paddle excised subsequently in two stages. Good muscle movement was obtained, providing resting symmetry and a pleasant smile. Other than soft-tissue and bony defects resulting from shotgun injuries, ablation of the facial nerve or facial mimetic muscles may be an important component of the defect that needs further consideration. The authors conclude that the current technique of one-stage, early definitive repair of soft tissues and facial reanimation in such cases of facial shotgun blast injury offers the advantages of achieving both goals with one flap and accomplishing the procedure primarily in one stage.},

Plast Reconstr Surg 1974;53:384-7] Smile reconstruction requires an understanding of the facial movements that occur during a normal smile. Facial reanimation should be tailored for each individual patient so that the movements on the reconstructed side are similar to that on the normal side. Aim: The aim of this study is to produce a quantitative analysis of smiles, as a basis for smile reconstruction and to compare our subject's smiles to the classification suggested by Rubin. Method: The smiles of 71 volunteers were analysed using three-dimensional (3D) stereophotogrammetry in x, y and z vectors. Each subject had the distances and angles of 10 surface landmarks (cheilion left and right (L\&R), labiale superius/inferius, mid-lateral upper/lower lip (L\&R), nasolabial fold (L\&R)) moved from the relaxed position to that in a maximum smile. All subjects' smiles were classified into the Rubin subtypes of corner of the mouth, canine and full-denture smile. Results: The average distances and angles moved by oral landmarks during a smile in a 3D plane were - cheilion: 16.6 mm at 31°; labiale superius: 8.2 mm at 31°; upper mid-lateral lip: 10.5 mm at 25°; labiale inferius: 5.3 mm at -56°; lower mid-lateral lip: 7.8 mm at 41° and nasolabial fold: 12.6 mm at 33°. Our population results for the smile subtypes suggested by Rubin were - corner-of-the-mouth smile: 77\%, canine smile: 15\% and full-denture smile: 8\%. Conclusion: Our study offers a simple quantitative method for measuring the smile to assess the outcome of reanimation surgery between different surgical procedures and units. Proportions of our study group with corner-of-the-mouth, canine and full-denture smiles were consistent with Rubin's study. © 2008 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.},

	abstract = {To investigate functional results of either one- or two-staged free muscle transplantation the scutuloauricularis model in the New Zealand white rabbit was used. Thirty rabbits were allocated to two groups with 15 animals each. In Group 1 (one-stage approach) peroneus brevis (PB) was harvested as a free muscle graft with a 7 cm long motor branch. The graft was positioned instead of right scutuloauricularis (SCUT) and its vascular supply microsurgically re-established. The motor branch was transferred to the contralateral side and its proximal end coapted to the cut facial motor branch to left SCUT. Before nerve coaptation biopsies were harvested from the cut motor branch for morphological analysis. In Group 2 (two-stage approach) a 7 cm long saphenous nerve graft was taken and coapted to the cut motor branch of SCUT and crossed over to the contralateral side. Nerve specimens from the cut motor branch were taken. Eight months later the free transplantation of PB was performed and its motor branch coapted to the distal end of the cross-over nerve graft. After a total time period of 13 months the final experiments were carried out in each group. Maximal tetanic tensions in reinnervated PB were measured and biopsies of muscle grafts together with nerve biopsies from the distal part of the motor branch were harvested for morphological analysis. Muscle grafts of Group 1 revealed tetanic tension values of 12.5 N (SD 3.1) in comparison to 10.6 N (SD 3.5) obtained in Group 2. This difference was not statistically significant (p=0.303). In Group 1, the amount of regenerated nerve fibers counted at the distal motor branch site (mean: 2798, SD 1242) was significantly higher (p=0.008) than in Group 2 (mean: 1138, SD 1004). Muscle graft morphology revealed significantly less Type I fibers (p=0.016) and more Type IIb/d fibers (p=0.011) in Group 1 compared to Group 2. However, the overall amount of perimysial connective tissue showed no significant difference in both groups (p=0.478). Free muscle transplantation in a one-stage approach offers similar functional results in comparison to the two-stage approach. Although muscle grafts of the one-stage transplantation underwent a longer period of denervation similar contents of perimysial connective tissue could be observed. © 2006 The British Association of Plastic Surgeons.},

	title = {Reanimation of reversible facial paralysis by the double innervation technique using an intraneural-dissected sural nerve graft},
	abstract = {In treating reversible facial paralysis, cross-facial nerve grafting offers voluntary and emotional reanimation. In contrast, rapid re-innervation and strong neural stimulation can be obtained with hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover. In this article, we describe the method of a combination of these techniques as a one-stage procedure. A 39-year-old man presented with facial paralysis due to nerve avulsion within the stylomastoid foramen. The sural nerve was harvested and two branches were created at its distal end by intraneural dissection. One branch was anastomosed to the contralateral facial nerve, and the other branch was used for hypoglossal-facial nerve crossover, followed by connecting the proximal stump of the graft to the trunk of the paralysed facial nerve in an end-to-end fashion. At 9 months postoperatively, almost complete facial symmetry and co-ordinated movements of the mimetic muscles were obtained with no obvious tongue atrophy. Since our method can efficiently gather neural inputs from the contralateral facial nerve and the ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve, it may become a good alternative for reanimation of reversible facial paralysis when the ipsilateral facial nerve is not available. © 2009 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.},

Throughout this period, several centers have demonstrated consistent success with functional muscle transfer; however, opinions regarding the arterial pedicle of the flap have varied. The lateral thoracic and thoracoacromial arteries have been proposed as the predominant arterial sources. It has been the experience of our unit that a vessel (not described in anatomy textbooks) arising directly from the axillary artery and entering the muscle from its dorsal surface provides the dominant supply to the flap and is capable of sustaining it for free-tissue transfer. The vascular pedicle encountered was recorded and photographed in 97 consecutive cases in which the pectoralis minor muscle flap was raised. The findings demonstrated that the dominant supply to the muscle was from a single artery in 77 percent of cases and took the form of an artery arising directly from the axillary vessel in 72 percent of cases. More than one major arterial source was noted in the remainder of the cases. The venous outflow was usually through single or multiple veins running directly from the muscle into the axillary vein.},

	title = {Microsurgical strategies in 74 patients for restoration of dynamic depressor muscle mechanism: {A} neglected target in facial reanimation},
	abstract = {The facial depressor muscles are an essential component of a full denture smile. In addition, the depressor muscles are actively used to express other human emotions such as sadness, anger, depression, and sorrow. Despite advances in microsurgical techniques, it is surprising how little effort has been directed toward reanimation of the lower lip. This article presents innovative approaches used in 74 patients by the senior author since 1981 for the dynamic reanimation of depressor muscle function. The surgical techniques include transfer of the anterior belly of the digastric muscle (n = 22) and transfer of the platysma muscle (n = 26) as a pedicled muscle to the corner of the mouth. Other surgical interventions used are the mini- hypoglossal nerve transfer to the cervicofacial branch of the ipsilateral facial nerve (n = 20), direct neurotization of the depressor muscles (n = 6), and facial-to-facial nerve transfer. The depressor muscle function was graded by four observers after reviewing standard preoperative and postoperative videotapes. Rating of the functional and aesthetic results was done according to the following arbitrary scale: excellent (2), good (1.5), moderate (1), fair (0.5), and poor (0). Sixty-nine percent of the patients who had a digastric muscle transfer displayed good to excellent results, and 24 percent showed moderate restoration of the depressor mechanism postoperatively. Eighty-three percent of patients who had platysma transfer to the lower lip demonstrated good to excellent outcome, and 11 percent had moderate depressor muscle function. In the hypoglossal nerve transfer group, 72 percent of the patients achieved good to excellent results and 15 percent had moderate function of the depressor mechanism. Of the patients who underwent direct neurotization, 34 percent showed good to excellent depressor muscle function postoperatively and 66 percent achieved fair depressor muscle function. Excellent outcome was noted in the patient with VII to VII nerve transfer. In conclusion, this article presents innovative approaches to restore dynamic depressor muscle function, which so far has been a neglected area of facial reanimation.},

	abstract = {Fifty-seven adult patients with facial paralysis, who underwent direct muscle neurotisation, were reviewed and divided into three categories depending on the function that direct neurotisation was aiming to augment. Group 1 included 30 patients who underwent direct neurotisation for eye closure and blink, group 2 consisted of 23 patients for smile augmentation, and group 3 comprised 31 patients for depressor. The age of the patients ranged from 21 to 74 years. Denervation time (Dt) ranged from 8 months to 42 years. Eight patients had partial facial paralysis, and 49 patients had complete facial paralysis. The results were based on the functional and electromyography (EMG) scoring of the neurotised muscles showing an overall EMG mean improvement of 26.56\% in eye closure, 34.47\% in smile restoration and 32.67\% in depressor function by the procedure. Median improvement in all facial functions was one grade (25\%) in theTerzis grading systems regarding the respective facial functions. The prerequisites are Dt less than 6 months and a functional contralateral facial nerve. In cases where Dt is more than 27 months and preoperative EMG's are silent, a free or pedicled muscle should be used to substitute the denervated native facial muscle.

CT findings revealed devastated cochlea and uncovered facial nerve, and progression of FP up to House–Brackmann grade 6 was observed. Therefore, we suspected recurrence of cystic VS or facial schwannoma, although MRI was inconsistent with that of schwannoma. The cyst was completely surgically excised, and histopathology confirmed CG diagnosis. Postoperatively her facial movement improved to grade 4. Recurrence has not been encountered since 7 years.

	title = {Management of vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas): {Auditory} and facial nerve function after resection of 120 vestibular schwannomas in patients with neurofibromatosis 2},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Vestibular schwannomas (VSs) affect young patients with Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF-2) and cause very serious problems for hearing, facial expression, and brain stem function. Our objective was to determine a therapy concept for the right timing and indication of neurosurgical therapy. METHODS: In 1000 consecutive VS resections, 120 tumors in 82 patients with NF-2 were surgically treated by the same surgeon (MS) at the Department of Neurosurgery at Nordstadt Hospital from 1978 to 1093. The mean age of the patients was 27.5 years. Sixty tumors were surgically treated in 41 male patients, and 60 tumors were surgically treated in 41 female patients. Bilateral tumor resection was performed in 38 patients (76 operations, after previous partial surgery in 15 cases elsewhere), and unilateral operations were performed in 44 patients, 5 of whom had undergone ipsi- or contralateral surgery that was performed elsewhere. The operative and clinical findings are evaluated and compared with the data of patients without NF-2. RESULTS: In 105 cases, complete tumor resections were achieved. In 15 cases, deliberate subtotal resections were performed. These were for brain stem decompression in 4 cases and for hearing preservation in the last hearing ear in 11 cases, with successful preservation in 8 of the 11. Pre- and postoperative hearing rates were higher in male than in female patients (70\% in male versus 65\% in female patients before surgery and 40.5 versus 31\%, respectively, after surgery). Hearing was preserved in 29 of 81 ears (36\%). The rate of preservation was 24\% in cases of large tumors and 57\% in cases of small tumors ({\textless}30 mm). Twenty-one of 82 patients (26\%) were bilaterally deaf before surgery. Twenty-five patients had uni- or bilateral hearing after surgery (i.e., 41\% of those with preoperative hearing or 30.5\% of the whole group). Anatomic facial nerve preservation was achieved in 85\%. The facial nerve was reconstructed intracranially at the cerebellopontine angle by sural grafting in 17 cases and by hypoglossal-facial reanimation in 5. Two deaths occurred 1 and 3 months postsurgically as a result of malignant tumor growth with brain stem dysfunction and respiratory problems. In summary, for patients with NF- 2, the presentation ages are lower, tumor progression is faster, the chances of anatomic and functional nerve preservation are lower, the chances of good outcomes are best when surgery is performed early and when there is good preoperative hearing function, and the danger of sudden hearing loss is higher. The chances and danger often differ from side to side among individual patients. CONCLUSION: The indication and the timing of tumor resections are in some respects different from normal VS handling and are dependent on the tumor extension and related necessity of brain stem decompression and on the auditory function. As an optimal goal, completeness of resection with functional cochlear nerve preservation is formulated, and as an acceptable compromise, subtotal microsurgical resection with functional cochlear nerve preservation in the last hearing ear is suggested.},

Methods: Tongue function in 39 consecutive patients and facial reanimation in 29 patients who completed 24 months follow-up were assessed. Facial nerve function was judged using the House-Brackmann (HB) grading system. Results: Tongue movements were normal in all operated on patients. Initial facial movements occurred on average 7.5 months postoperatively. The results were graded HB II in 6 (20.9\%), HB III in 13 (44.6\%), HB IV in 7 (24.1\%), HB V in 2 (6.8\%) patients, and HB VI in 1 (3.4\%) patient. The results were significantly better in young patients and when a short time interval between paralysis and surgery existed.

	title = {Indication, technique and results of facial nerve reconstruction},
	abstract = {160 patients with various intra- or extracranial pathologies were treated by microsurgical facial nerve reconstruction at Nordstadt Neurosurgical Clinic between 1978 and 1993. Facial nerve reconstruction was accomplished along the anatomical course of the facial nerve from its origin at the brainstem, within the mastoid, at the stylomastoid foramen and within the face. Mostly, reconstruction was indicated because of nerve discontinuity (n = 61), whereas facial nerve reanimation with a donor nerve such as the contralateral facial nerve or the ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve was indicated in 99 cases of loss of a proximal nerve stump. Depending on the site of the lesion reinnervation started at 5 to 15 months postoperatively lasting for 2 to 3 years with overall satisfactory results. 69\% of all the patients regained good symmetry on rest, complete eye closure equivalent to House-Brackmann-Score III: Patients with complete failures either suffered of non-related diseases such as cancer leading to death before the estimated time of recovery or were exposed to radiation or received facial nerve reconstruction after long-standing facial deficit and marked muscular atrophy. The indication of the adequate method depends on the clinical course with or without preexisting facial paresis, on considering the intraoperative state of the facial nerve. the identification and microsurgical preparation of adequate nerve stumps, as well as on the adaptation techniques and the postoperative guidance of the patient. We conclude that facial nerve reconstruction by transplantation at either site of the nerve course or by reanimation with a donor nerve are effective and reliable procedures of treatment leading to satisfactory functional and cosmetic results.},

These cases demonstrate the possibility for the use of simultaneous dissection of the face and flaps, and the reliability of the vascular pedicle.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional free muscle transfer for the surgical correction of long-standing facial paralysis has gained validity over the past three decades. These traditionally multistep reconstructions often achieve clinical success, but at the cost of significant morbidity and lengthy recovery periods. To address this dilemma, the authors propose reconstruction using the rectus abdominis and accompanying intercostal nerve in a one-stage neurovascular free flap reanimation procedure. METHODS: Between 1998 and 2001, five patients with long-standing unilateral facial paralysis at the University of Pittsburgh Facial Nerve Center underwent reanimation using the authors' protocol. Preoperative and postoperative assessments included clinical evaluation using the Facial Grading System and electromyography. The patients were followed for a mean of 16 months. RESULTS: At the final postoperative visit, all five patients demonstrated improved levator electromyographic potential, with a median 67 percent improvement. All five patients further demonstrated an increase in zygomaticus electromyographic potential, with a median 225 percent improvement. All five patients demonstrated increased Facial Grading System score at most recent follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The one-step reanimation using free rectus abdominis neurovascular free flap demonstrated a consistent positive outcome in electromyographic and clinical assessments. The additional benefits of reduced recovery time and anatomical reliability of the flap render the authors' method preferable to other traditional methods of surgical reanimation of the paralyzed face.

After wide excision of the tumor, including the facial nerve except the temporal branch and part of the zygomatic major muscle and masseter muscle, the authors reconstructed the cheek skin and provided movement by performing a small-segment latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap transfer using Harii's method and the defect of the buccal and marginal mandibular branches of the facial nerve by funicular grafting from one of the two funicles of the thoracodorsal nerve. After 6 months, the transplanted, small-segment latissimus dorsi muscle showed good voluntary movement, and the lower orbiculus oris and depressor oris presented good functional recovery. The authors believe the two funicles of the thoracodorsal nerve can be used independently for two purposes: one for functional segmental muscle transfer and the other for nerve grafting to defects of branches of the facial nerve. This concept makes it possible to reconstruct multiple facial movements while minimizing donor site morbidity by means of immediate facial reanimation.},

Study Design Case series with chart review. Setting Two tertiary-care medical centers. Subjects and Methods A two-institution retrospective review from 2002 to 2009 was conducted for buried free flaps utilized in reconstruction of defects from total parotidectomy with or without neck dissection. Patients with temporal bone or skin resections were excluded. Demographic information, tumor characteristics, surgical interventions, flap details, and adjunctive facial reconstructive techniques were recorded. Postoperative cosmetic results were evaluated by patient and physician satisfaction. Results Eighteen patients with a mean age of 57.4 years underwent flap reconstruction. Total parotidectomy was performed in all cases, 11 cases required facial nerve sacrifice, and 14 cases included neck dissection. The anterolateral thigh flap was the most often utilized free flap. Mean flap area was 65.5 cm(2). Adjunctive static facial reanimation was employed in eight patients. All flaps survived. Ten patients underwent adjuvant radiation. Free flap reconstruction resulted in cosmetic patient and surgeon satisfaction, despite adjuvant radiation therapy.

Stronger upper lip elevation and sufficient elevation of the modiolus with a proper 3-directional movement were demonstrated. Copyright © 2006 by Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

	abstract = {Donor-site morbidity in serratus anterior free-tissue transfers is investigated in 34 consecutive cases. Nineteen lower-extremity reconstructions end 15 facial reconstructions were retrospectively analyzed. Office and hospital charts were reviewed, and patients were given a follow- up questionnaire. The mean operative time was 6.3 hr and the mean estimated blood loss was 441 cc. Transfusion was required in 24 percent of cases. The early complication rate was 21 percent consisting of 6 percent hematomas and 15 percent seromas. Scar appearance, pain, numbness and shoulder strength and mobility were acceptable. Scapular winging was detectable in 3/9 patients examined but symptomatic in only one. The number of muscle slips harvested or whether the graft was innervated did not significantly affect this rate. Half of the patients had returned to work or school. None attributed any work disability to their donor sites. They participated in many athletic activities including those requiring upper extremity strength and dexterity. Previously reported series are discussed and the morbidity of this donor site is compared with reported series of other free muscle flaps. The authors find this flap useful for facial reanimation and for soft-tissue coverage with minimal bulk. Low rates of operative, perioperative, and long-term morbidity are definite advantages.},

	abstract = {Objectives/Hypothesis The hypoglossal-facial-anastomosis is the most often applied procedure for the reanimation of a long lasting peripheral facial nerve paralysis. The use of an interposition graft and its end-to-side anastomosis to the hypoglossal nerve allows the preservation of the tongue function and also requires two anastomosis sites and a free second donor nerve. We describe the modified technique of the hypoglossal-facial-jump-anastomosis without an interposition and present the first results. Study Design Retrospective case study. Methods We performed the facial nerve reconstruction in five patients. The indication for the surgery was a long-standing facial paralysis with preserved portion distal to geniculate ganglion, absent voluntary activity in the needle facial electromyography, and an intact bilateral hypoglossal nerve. Following mastoidectomy, the facial nerve was mobilized in the fallopian canal down to its bifurcation in the parotid gland and cut in its tympanic portion distal to the lesion. Then, a tensionless end-to-side suture to the hypoglossal nerve was performed. The facial function was monitored up to 16 months postoperatively. Results The reconstruction technique succeeded in all patients: The facial function improved within the average time period of 10 months to the House-Brackmann score 3. Conclusion This modified technique of the hypoglossal-facial reanimation is a valid method with good clinical results, especially in cases of a preserved intramastoidal facial nerve.

Methods: Facial function was assessed after operation using a 7-point visual analog scale (VAS) and by electromyography (EMG) in 53 patients. The final result was judged by May's facial nerve grading system. Results: Voluntary EMG activity occurred on average 4.52 ± 1.31 months after operation. Initial facial movements were visible after 5.41 ± 1.80 months. Facial function related to the VAS finally reached 44\% of normal value. The result was judged May's grade I in 13\%, grade II in 34\%, grade III in 28\%, and grade IV in 25\% of patients. A significant difference in outcome between different reconstruction types was not seen. Age over 60 years was related to worse outcome.

	abstract = {Objective: This study aims to analyse the efficacy of static techniques, namely gold weight implant and tendon sling, in the reanimation of the paralytic eyelid. Upper eyelid rehabilitation in terms of excursion and blinking velocity is performed using the automatic motion capture system, FACIAL CLIMA. Methods: Seventy-four patients underwent a total of 101 procedures including 58 upper eyelid gold weight implants and 43 lower eyelid tendon suspension with 27 patients undergoing both procedures. The presence of lagophtalmos, eye dryness, corneal ulcer, epiphora and lower lid ptosis/ectropion was assessed preoperatively. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare preoperative versus postoperative measurements of upper eyelid excursion and blinking velocity determined with FACIAL CLIMA. Significance was set at p {\textless}0.05. Results: FACIAL CLIMA revealed significant improvement of eyelid excursion and velocity of blinking (p {\textless} 0.001). Eye dryness improved in 49 patients (90.7\%) and corneal ulcer resolved without any further treatment in 12 (85.7\%) of those with a gold weight inserted. Implant extrusion was observed in 8.6\% of the cases. Of the patients with lower lid tendon suspension, correction of ptosis/ectropion and epiphora was achieved in 93.9\% and 91.9\% of cases, respectively. In eight patients (18.6\%), further surgery was needed to adjust tendon tension. Conclusions: The paralytic upper and lower eyelid can be successfully managed with gold weight implant and tendon suspension. The FACIAL CLIMA system is a reliable method to quantify upper eyelid excursion and blinking velocity and to detect the exact position of the lower eyelid. © 2012 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

	abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to establish the anatomic basis of the conjoint medial circumflex femoral perforator and gracilis muscle flap and to expand the use of this flap in complex facial paralysis reconstruction. Methods: An anatomic study was initially undertaken to record the existence, consistency, and diameter of musculocutaneous perforators emanating from the proximal third of the gracilis muscle to provide blood supply to the overlying fascia, subcutaneous fat, and skin. In a total of 20 clinical cases of gracilis muscle harvesting, the aforementioned anatomical data were recorded during flap dissection. At least one musculocutaneus perforator, consisting of one artery and two accompanying veins (vein caliber {\textgreater} 0.3 mm) was found in 95 percent of cases. Results: The anatomical study was followed by successful use of the conjoint flap for reconstruction of longstanding facial palsy accompanied by a soft-tissue defect of the cheek. In the first stage, cross-face nerve grafting was performed. In the second stage, free transfer of the conjoint flap, consisting of the proximal third of the gracilis muscle and the overlying subcutaneous fat, was performed to the face. The only connection between the two components of the conjoint flap was one musculocutaneous perforator. When the flap was inset, the muscle was used for facial reanimation and partial obliteration of the soft-tissue defect, while the subcutaneous fat was used to obliterate the rest of the defect Conclusion: The proposed technique ensured symmetry of the face, on both rest and animation, and obliteration of the cheek deformity.},

	abstract = {Background: Reinnervation of the facial musculature when there is loss of the proximal facial nerve poses a difficult clinical problem. Restoration of spontaneous mimetic motion is the aim and, to this end, the use of cross-facial nerve grafts has long been considered the reconstruction of choice. The nerve to masseter has been used very successfully for reinnervation of microvascular functioning muscle transfers for facial reanimation in established facial palsy but its use as a direct nerve transfer to the facial nerve to reinnervate 'viable' facial musculature has been scarce. Methods: Electron micrographic studies of axonal counts in the nerve to masseter and nerve to gracilis in a clinical series of seven patients undergoing surgery for facial nerve palsy were made. Based on these results, and previous success with the use of the nerve to masseter for reinnervation of free gracilis transfers, we report our experience with the transfer of the nerve to masseter for direct coaptation with the ipsilateral facial nerve to restore facial motion. Results: Our axonal counts of the nerve to masseter have, on average, 1542 ± 291.70 (SD) axons. Historical data have shown that the buccal branch of the facial nerve has 834 ± 285 (SD) where the distal end of a cross-facial nerve graft has 100 to 200 axons. Our clinical use of the nerve to masseter as a direct nerve transfer in three patients based on these data has resulted in significant improvement in facial symmetry in repose (at a minimum of 1 year follow up), restoration of facial motion with occasional spontaneous activity and minimal synkinesis without any donor morbidity. Conclusions: The advantages of this technique include the ease of dissection, constant and reliable anatomy, powerful reinnervation of the facial muscles without donor site morbidity and the potential for return of spontaneous facial movement.

	abstract = {Temporalis muscle transfer for paralytic lagophthalmos, which was first proposed by Gillies and later developed by Andersen, has been one of the most common treatment modalities for paralytic lagophthalmos. However, there have been no scientific reports statistically analysing the efficacy of temporalis muscle transfer. We, therefore, retrospectively analysed the functional and aesthetic results of temporalis muscle transfer. Between 1994 and 2006, we carried out temporalis muscle transfer (the so-called Gillies-Andersen method) on 95 established facial paralysis patients. We sent a postal questionnaire to these patients and 47 of them responded. The functional and aesthetic results were analysed based on the patients' replies together with clinical records and photographs, and unfavourable factors of this procedure were investigated. After surgery, most ocular symptoms (mechanical irritation, dry eye, soreness, and discharge) improved significantly. Achievement rate of complete eye closure was 78.7\%. A morphometric study revealed that possible unfavourable factors (old age, intracranial disease, use of dentures, etc.) did not affect the achievement rates of complete eye closure. Deformity of eyelid fissure due to undue tension of the temporal fascia fixation was found in nine patients (19.1\%) and six of these patients underwent secondary revision. Unlike lid loading with a gold implant, the results of temporalis muscle transfer depend greatly on the surgeon's skill. However, if this procedure is performed properly, strong eye closure can be obtained. We, therefore, recommend temporalis muscle transfer as the preferred option for reconstruction of paralytic lagophthalmos. © 2008 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.},

Mercury data consisted of gaseous elemental Hg (GEM) and "reactive Hg" (RM), which is a combination of the gaseous oxidized (GOM) and particulate bound ({\textless} 2.5 μm) (PBM) fractions as measured by the Tekran$^{\textrm{®}}$ system. We used a subset of the observations by defining a "free tropospheric" (FT) data set by screening using measured water vapor mixing ratios. The oxidation scheme used by the GEOS-Chem model was varied between the standard run with Br oxidation and an alternative run with OH–O$_{\textrm{3}}$ oxidation. We used this model–measurement comparison to help interpret the spatio-temporal trends in, and relationships among, the Hg species and ancillary parameters, to understand better the sources and fate of atmospheric RM. The most salient feature of the data across sites, seen more in summer relative to spring, was that RM was negatively correlated with GEM and water vapor mixing ratios (WV) and positively correlated with ozone (O$_{\textrm{3}}$), both in the standard model and the observations, indicating that RM was formed in dry upper altitude air from the photo-oxidation of GEM. During a free tropospheric transport high RM event observed sequentially at three sites from Oregon to Nevada, the slope of the RM / GEM relationship at the westernmost site was −1020 ± 209 pg ng$^{\textrm{−1}}$, indicating near-quantitative GEM-to-RM photochemical conversion. An improved correlation between the observations and the model was seen when the model was run with the OH–O$_{\textrm{3}}$ oxidation scheme instead of the Br oxidation scheme. This simulation produced higher concentrations of RM and lower concentrations of GEM, especially at the desert sites in northwestern Nevada. This suggests that future work should investigate the effect of Br- and O$_{\textrm{3}}$-initiated gas-phase oxidation occurring simultaneously in the atmosphere, as well as aqueous and heterogeneous reactions to understand whether there are multiple global oxidants for GEM and hence multiple forms of RM in the atmosphere. If the chemical forms of RM were known, then the collection efficiency of the analytical method could be evaluated better.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Mercury (Hg) is emitted to the atmosphere mainly as volatile elemental Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$. Oxidation to water-soluble Hg$^{\textrm{II}}$ plays a major role in Hg deposition to ecosystems. Here, we implement a new mechanism for atmospheric Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$ ∕ Hg$^{\textrm{II}}$ redox chemistry in the GEOS-Chem global model and examine the implications for the global atmospheric Hg budget and deposition patterns. Our simulation includes a new coupling of GEOS-Chem to an ocean general circulation model (MITgcm), enabling a global 3-D representation of atmosphere–ocean Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$ ∕ Hg$^{\textrm{II}}$ cycling. We find that atomic bromine (Br) of marine organobromine origin is the main atmospheric Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$ oxidant and that second-stage HgBr oxidation is mainly by the NO$_{\textrm{2}}$ and HO$_{\textrm{2}}$ radicals. The resulting chemical lifetime of tropospheric Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$ against oxidation is 2.7 months, shorter than in previous models. Fast Hg$^{\textrm{II}}$ atmospheric reduction must occur in order to match the ∼ 6-month lifetime of Hg against deposition implied by the observed atmospheric variability of total gaseous mercury (TGM ≡ Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$ + Hg$^{\textrm{II}}$(g)). We implement this reduction in GEOS-Chem as photolysis of aqueous-phase Hg$^{\textrm{II}}$–organic complexes in aerosols and clouds, resulting in a TGM lifetime of 5.2 months against deposition and matching both mean observed TGM and its variability. Model sensitivity analysis shows that the interhemispheric gradient of TGM, previously used to infer a longer Hg lifetime against deposition, is misleading because Southern Hemisphere Hg mainly originates from oceanic emissions rather than transport from the Northern Hemisphere. The model reproduces the observed seasonal TGM variation at northern midlatitudes (maximum in February, minimum in September) driven by chemistry and oceanic evasion, but it does not reproduce the lack of seasonality observed at southern hemispheric marine sites. Aircraft observations in the lowermost stratosphere show a strong TGM–ozone relationship indicative of fast Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$ oxidation, but we show that this relationship provides only a weak test of Hg chemistry because it is also influenced by mixing. The model reproduces observed Hg wet deposition fluxes over North America, Europe, and China with little bias (0–30 \%). It reproduces qualitatively the observed maximum in US deposition around the Gulf of Mexico, reflecting a combination of deep convection and availability of NO$_{\textrm{2}}$ and HO$_{\textrm{2}}$ radicals for second-stage HgBr oxidation. However, the magnitude of this maximum is underestimated. The relatively low observed Hg wet deposition over rural China is attributed to fast Hg$^{\textrm{II}}$ reduction in the presence of high organic aerosol concentrations. We find that 80 \% of Hg$^{\textrm{II}}$ deposition is to the global oceans, reflecting the marine origin of Br and low concentrations of organic aerosols for Hg$^{\textrm{II}}$ reduction. Most of that deposition takes place to the tropical oceans due to the availability of HO$_{\textrm{2}}$ and NO$_{\textrm{2}}$ for second-stage HgBr oxidation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We can reproduce these observations with the GEOS-Chem global tropospheric chemistry model by including a broader consideration of multiphase halogen (Br-Cl) chemistry than has been done in the past. Important reactions for regenerating BrO from its nonradical reservoirs include HOBr + Br−/Cl− in both aerosols and clouds, and oxidation of Br− by ClNO3 and ozone. Most tropospheric BrO in the model is in the free troposphere, consistent with observations and originates mainly from the photolysis and oxidation of ocean-emitted CHBr3. Stratospheric input is also important in the upper troposphere. Including production of gas phase inorganic bromine from debromination of acidified sea salt aerosol increases free tropospheric Bry by about 30\%. We find HOBr to be the dominant gas-phase reservoir of inorganic bromine. Halogen (Br-Cl) radical chemistry as implemented here in GEOS-Chem drives 14\% and 11\% decreases in the global burdens of tropospheric ozone and OH, respectively, a 16\% increase in the atmospheric lifetime of methane, and an atmospheric lifetime of 6 months for elemental mercury. The dominant mechanism for the Br-Cl driven tropospheric ozone decrease is oxidation of NOx by formation and hydrolysis of BrNO3 and ClNO3.},

Emitted to the atmosphere in its elemental form, mercury travels worldwide before oxidizing to a form that deposits to ecosystems. In aquatic systems, mercury can convert into methylmercury, a potent neurotoxin. People and wildlife are exposed to methylmercury as it bioaccumulates up the food chain. Mercury continues to circulate in the atmosphere, oceans, and terrestrial system for centuries to millennia before it returns to deep-ocean sediments. Areas of uncertainty in the global biogeochemical cycle of mercury include oxidation processes in the atmosphere, land-atmosphere and ocean-atmosphere cycling, and methylation processes in the ocean.

	abstract = {Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant that affects human and ecosystem health. We synthesize understanding of sources, atmosphere-land-ocean Hg dynamics and health effects, and consider the implications of Hg-control policies. Primary anthropogenic Hg emissions greatly exceed natural geogenic sources, resulting in increases in Hg reservoirs and subsequent secondary Hg emissions that facilitate its global distribution. The ultimate fate of emitted Hg is primarily recalcitrant soil pools and deep ocean waters and sediments. Transfers of Hg emissions to largely unavailable reservoirs occur over the time scale of centuries, and are primarily mediated through atmospheric exchanges of wet/dry deposition and evasion from vegetation, soil organic matter and ocean surfaces. A key link between inorganic Hg inputs and exposure of humans and wildlife is the net production of methylmercury, which occurs mainly in reducing zones in freshwater, terrestrial, and coastal environments, and the subsurface ocean. Elevated human exposure to methylmercury primarily results from consumption of estuarine and marine fish. Developing fetuses are most at risk from this neurotoxin but health effects of highly exposed populations and wildlife are also a concern. Integration of Hg science with national and international policy efforts is needed to target efforts and evaluate efficacy.},

We use Bayesian inversion methods combining simulations with GEOS-Chem and ground-based Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$ observations from regional monitoring networks and individual sites in recent years. Using optimized emissions/parameters, GEOS-Chem better reproduces these ground-based observations and also matches regional over-water Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$ and wet deposition measurements. The optimized global mercury emission to the atmosphere is {\textasciitilde} 5.8 Gg yr$^{\textrm{−1}}$. The ocean accounts for 3.2 Gg yr$^{\textrm{−1}}$ (55 \% of the total), and the terrestrial ecosystem is neither a net source nor a net sink of Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$. The optimized Asian anthropogenic emission of Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$ (gas elemental mercury) is 650–1770 Mg yr$^{\textrm{−1}}$, higher than its bottom-up estimates (550–800 Mg yr$^{\textrm{−1}}$). The ocean parameter inversions suggest that dark oxidation of aqueous elemental mercury is faster, and less mercury is removed from the mixed layer through particle sinking, when compared with current simulations. Parameter changes affect the simulated global ocean mercury budget, particularly mass exchange between the mixed layer and subsurface waters. Based on our inversion results, we re-evaluate the long-term global biogeochemical cycle of mercury, and show that legacy mercury becomes more likely to reside in the terrestrial ecosystem than in the ocean. We estimate that primary anthropogenic mercury contributes up to 23 \% of present-day atmospheric deposition.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The inversion uses the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM) and its adjoint applied to MOPITT, AIRS, and SCIAMACHY. Observations from TES, surface sites (NOAA/GMD), and aircraft (MOZAIC) are used for evaluation of the a posteriori solution. Using GEOS-Chem as a common intercomparison platform shows global consistency between the different satellite datasets and with the in situ data. Differences can be largely explained by different averaging kernels and a priori information. The global CO emission from combustion as constrained in the inversion is 1350 Tg a$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$. This is much higher than current bottom-up emission inventories. A large fraction of the correction results from a seasonal underestimate of CO sources at northern mid-latitudes in winter and suggests a larger-than-expected CO source from vehicle cold starts and residential heating. Implementing this seasonal variation of emissions solves the long-standing problem of models underestimating CO in the northern extratropics in winter-spring. A posteriori emissions also indicate a general underestimation of biomass burning in the GFED2 inventory. However, the tropical biomass burning constraints are not quantitatively consistent across the different datasets.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Atmospheric transport models can be used to infer surface fluxes of atmospheric CO2 from observed concentrations using inverse methods. One of the main problem of these methods is the question of their sensivity to all the parameters involved in the calculation. In this paper we study precisely the influence of the main parameters on the net CO2 fluxes inferred by an annual Bayesian three-dimensional (3-D) inversion of atmospheric CO2 monthly concentrations. This inversion is described as the control inversion (S0) of Bousquet et al. [this issue]. Successively, at regional to global spatial scales we analyze the numerical stability of the solution to initial fluxes and errors, the influence of a priori flux scenario, the sensitivity to the atmospheric transport model used, the influence of δ13C measurements, and the influence of the atmospheric network. We find that the atmospheric transport model introduces a large uncertainty to the inferred budget, which overcomes our control run uncertainties. The effects of vertical transport on CO2 concentrations appear to be a critical point that has to be investigated further. Spatial patterns of fluxes also have significant influence on a regional basis. We notice that accounting for the Baltic Sea station (BAL) deeply modifies the Europe versus Asia partition of the land uptake at mid and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. We also analyze the weak influence of using δ13C measurements as additional constraints. In the tropics we find that the low level of constraints imposed by the atmospheric network limits the analysis of fluxes to zonal means. Finally, we calculate overall estimates of CO2 net sources and sinks at continental scale, accounting for all sensivity tests. Concerning the controversial partition of CO2 sink at mid and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, we find (on average, for the 1985–1995 period) an overall partition of the sink of 0.7±0.7 Gt C yr1 for North America, 0.2±0.3 Gt C yr−1 for the North Pacific Ocean, 0.5±0.8 Gt C yr−1 for Europe, 0.7±0.3 Gt C yr−1 for the North Atlantic Ocean, and 1.2±0.8 Gt C yr−1 for north Asia. This overall partition tends to place an important land uptake over north Asia. However, uncertainties remain large when we account for all the sensitivity tests.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric mercury is predominantly present in the gaseous elemental form (Hg0). However, anthropogenic emissions (e.g., incineration, fossil fuel combustion) emit and natural processes create particulate-phase mercury (Hg(p)) and divalent reactive gas-phase mercury (RGM). RGM species (e.g., HgCl2, HgBr2) are water-soluble and have much shorter residence times in the atmosphere than Hg0 due to their higher removal rates through wet and dry deposition mechanisms. Manual and automated annular denuder methodologies, to provide high-resolution (1−2 h) ambient RGM measurements, were developed and evaluated. Following collection of RGM onto KCl-coated quartz annular denuders, RGM was thermally decomposed and quantified as Hg0. Laboratory and field evaluations of the denuders found the RGM collection efficiency to be {\textgreater}94\% and mean collocated precision to be {\textless}15\%. Method detection limits for sampling durations ranging from 1 to 12 h were 6.2−0.5 pg m-3, respectively. As part of this research, the authors observed that methods to measure Hg(p) had a significant positive artifact when RGM coexists with Hg(p). This artifact was eliminated if a KCl-coated annular denuder preceded the filter. This new atmospheric mercury speciation methodology has dramatically enhanced our ability to investigate the mechanisms of transformation and deposition of mercury in the atmosphere.},

Within each topic, the panel drew a series of conclusions, which are presented in this paper. These conclusions led us to concur that the answer to our question is a “qualified yes,” with the qualification being dependent upon the level of uncertainty one is willing to accept. We agreed that the uncertainty is strongly dependent upon scale and that our question as stated is answerable with greater confidence both very near and very far from major point sources, assuming that the “global pool” is a recognizable “source.” Many regions of interest from an ecosystem-exposure standpoint lie in between, where source attribution carries the greatest degree of uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Mercury (Hg) is a global health concern due to its toxicity and ubiquitous presence in the environment. Here we review current methods for measuring the forms of Hg in the atmosphere and models used to interpret these data. There are three operationally defined forms of atmospheric Hg: gaseous elemental mercury (GEM), gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM), and particulate bound mercury (PBM). There is relative confidence in GEM measurements (collection on a gold surface), but GOM (collection on potassium chloride (KCl)-coated denuder) and PBM (collected using various methods) are less well understood. Field and laboratory investigations suggest the methods to measure GOM and PBM are impacted by analytical interferences that vary with environmental setting (e.g., ozone, relative humidity), and GOM concentrations measured by the KCl-coated denuder can be too low by a factor of 1.6 to 12 depending on the chemical composition of GOM. The composition of GOM (e.g., HgBr2, HgCl2, HgBrOH) varies across space and time. This has important implications for refining existing measurement methods and developing new ones, model/measurement comparisons, model development, and assessing trends. Unclear features of previously published data may now be re-examined and possibly explained, which is demonstrated through a case study. Priorities for future research include identification of GOM compounds in ambient air and development of information on their chemical and physical properties and GOM and PBM calibration systems. With this information, identification of redox mechanisms and associated rate coefficients may be developed.},

The latter included the University of Washington-Detector for Oxidized Mercury, the University of Houston Mercury instrument, and a filter-based system under development by the University of Nevada-Reno. Good transmission of total Hg was found for the manifold. However, despite application of standard protocols and rigorous quality control, systematic differences in operationally defined forms of Hg were measured by the sampling systems. Concentrations of reactive Hg (RM) measured with new methods were at times 2-to-3-fold higher than that measured by Tekran system. The low RM recovery by the latter can be attributed to lack of collection as the system is currently configured. Concentrations measured by all instruments were influenced by their sampling location in-the-manifold and the instrument analytical configuration. On the basis of collective assessment of the data, we hypothesize that reactions forming RM were occurring in the manifold.

	abstract = {Mercury is a global pollutant that poses threats to ecosystems and to human health. Due to its global transport, mercury contamination is found in regions of the Earth that are remote from major emissions areas, including the Polar regions. Global anthropogenic emission inventories identify important sectors and industries responsible for emissions at a national level; however, to be useful for air transport modelling, more precise information on the locations of emission is required. This paper describes the methodology applied, and the results of work that was conducted to geospatially distribute anthropogenic mercury emissions as part of the global anthropogenic mercury emissions inventory for 2015 prepared by AMAP/UNEP for the Global Mercury Assessment (GMA) 2018 (UN Environment, 2019). This work includes the identification and use of emission point sources as well as distributing diffuse emissions for 21 emission (industry) sectors. The basic approach involves assigning emission estimates to geo-located point sources, using reported emissions information where available, and otherwise assigning a modelled emission to the point. Emissions which cannot be assigned to point sources are distributed using sector-specific proxies. Mercury speciation highly depends on industry processes and air pollution control technology. Different Hg speciation ratios are therefore applied per sector and country technology level. The resulting global emission datasets include total mercury (HgT), gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0), divalent mercury (Hg2+) and particulate mercury (HgP) in kg per year per raster cell (kg/a). The spatial resolution is flexible and the vertical resolution of the data is based on a set of predefined height classes. The resolution of the GMA2018 emission data is 0.25° × 0.25° with three (physical emission) height classes (0–50, 50–150 and {\textgreater} 150m). A comparison with the EMEP European mercury emission was made based on spatial correlation between the two datasets. Suggested improvements for future work include the further development of proxy data and the implementation of a more structured reporting of emissions by countries.},

The PDFs are constrained by observations of tracer concentrations and account for uncertainty in meteorology, transport, diffusion, and emissions. Meteorological uncertainty is calculated using an ensemble of simulations of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model that samples five categories of model inputs (initialization time, boundary layer physics, land surface model, nudging options, and reanalysis data). The WRF output is used to drive tens of thousands of FLEXPART dispersion simulations that sample a uniform distribution of six emissions inputs. Machine-learning algorithms are trained on the ensemble data and used to quantify the sources of ensemble variability and to infer, via inverse modeling, the values of the 11 model inputs most consistent with tracer measurements. We find a substantial ensemble spread in tracer concentrations (factors of 10 to 10$^{\textrm{3}}$), most of which is due to changing emissions inputs (about 80 \%), though the cumulative effects of meteorological variations are not negligible. The performance of the inverse method is verified using synthetic observations generated from arbitrarily selected simulations. When applied to measurements from a controlled tracer release experiment, the inverse method satisfactorily determines the location, start time, duration and amount. In a 2 km × 2 km area of possible locations, the actual location is determined to within 200 m. The start time is determined to within 5 min out of 2 h, and the duration to within 50 min out of 4 h. Over a range of release amounts of 10 to 1000 kg, the estimated amount exceeds the actual amount of 146 kg by only 32 kg. The inversion also estimates probabilities of different WRF configurations. To best match the tracer observations, the highest-probability cases in WRF are associated with using a late initialization time and specific reanalysis data products.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The Global Mercury Observation System (GMOS) project was funded by the European Commission ({\textless}a href="http://www.gmos.eu" target="\_blank"{\textgreater}http://www.gmos.eu{\textless}/a{\textgreater}) and started in November 2010 with the overall goal to develop a coordinated global observing system to monitor Hg on a global scale, including a large network of ground-based monitoring stations, ad hoc periodic oceanographic cruises and measurement flights in the lower and upper troposphere as well as in the lower stratosphere. To date, more than 40 ground-based monitoring sites constitute the global network covering many regions where little to no observational data were available before GMOS. This work presents atmospheric Hg concentrations recorded worldwide in the framework of the GMOS project (2010–2015), analyzing Hg measurement results in terms of temporal trends, seasonality and comparability within the network. Major findings highlighted in this paper include a clear gradient of Hg concentrations between the Northern and Southern hemispheres, confirming that the gradient observed is mostly driven by local and regional sources, which can be anthropogenic, natural or a combination of both.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Examples include nonnegativity (e.g., emissions of some urban air pollutants) or upward limits implied by reaction or solubility constants. However, probabilistic inverse modeling approaches based on Gaussian assumptions cannot incorporate such bounds and thus often produce unrealistic results. The atmospheric literature lacks consensus on the best means to overcome this problem, and existing atmospheric studies rely on a limited number of the possible methods with little examination of the relative merits of each. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} This paper investigates the applicability of several approaches to bounded inverse problems. A common method of data transformations is found to unrealistically skew estimates for the examined example application. The method of Lagrange multipliers and two Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods yield more realistic and accurate results. In general, the examined MCMC approaches produce the most realistic result but can require substantial computational time. Lagrange multipliers offer an appealing option for large, computationally intensive problems when exact uncertainty bounds are less central to the analysis. A synthetic data inversion of US anthropogenic methane emissions illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

After examining the long historical trajectory that has relegated most ASM activities in sub-Saharan Africa to the informal economy, three of the sector’s more obvious economic impacts are reviewed: its contribution to regional mineral outputs; how operations create employment opportunities for millions of people directly, and millions more in the downstream and upstream industries they spawn; and the links the sector has with subsistence agriculture, dynamics which have important implications for food security and gender equality. These contributions alone are sufficient justification for featuring ASM more prominently in the plans, policies and programs being launched in sub-Saharan Africa to help host governments meet their commitments to the SDGs.},

The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimated in 1999 that ASM employed 13 million people iworldwide, making an important contribution to poverty alleviation in rural areas. Despite this positive contribution, the sector often brings a series of environmental and social problems to the areas in which it occurs. The case studies developed for this report ii illustrate that ASGM can transform itself quickly when the correct regulatory, economic, and other conditions are put in place. The sector has a demonstrated ability to seize opportunities, as shown in the case of Peru, and more recently Mongolia, where legal frameworks were promulgated resulting in a “rush” to obtain new mining licenses, iii or in the case of ethical initiatives in which the uptake by the producer organizations of the fair trade certification scheme has been very high. iv This report concludes that high levels of ASGM informality are rooted mainly in legal, political, and economic marginalization vor where legal frameworks and other public policy plans and programs exist but are not designed to address the unique challenges of the sector. It is clear from previous experience, especially UNIDO’s Global Mercury Project, vi that international cooperation and national support for the sector is desirable and welcome. To be effective, the support must be long-term and must deal with the root causes of problems (such as inadequate public policy and a lack of environmental, technical, and entrepreneurial knowledge) while also addressing health, safety, and environmental concerns. In doing so, it will be possible to create the conditions for ASGM to become a profitable and sustainable mining sector.},

	abstract = {Artisanal and small-scale gold mining has been practiced since ancient times in Peru, currently it is developed throughout the national territory, although concentrated in certain regions. Most of this activity is carried out informally and even illegally, characterized by the use of a large amount of labor and low technology; In recent years, situations such as the high price of gold have caused a great growth in this activity. During 2017, as part of the activities of the project of the National Action Plan for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining, led by the Artisanal Gold Council, UNIDO and with financing from the World Environment Fund, the reference estimates of the use and mercury consumption in ASM. For the development of the estimates, the methodology by Artisanal Gold Council (2015) was used in the Practical Guide for the development of Reference Estimates of the use of Mercury in artisanal and small-scale gold, 2015, accepted by the United Nations. The work focused on the regions of Madre de Dios, Puno, Arequipa and Ayacucho, since they concentrate approximately 94\% of ASM gold production. Among the main results found, it stands out that: The estimated artisanal and small-scale gold production in Peru is 148.77 tons per year, of which 87.97\% is processed by amalgamation with mercury, the remaining 12\% corresponds mainly to cyanidation. The use of mercury for artisanal and smallscale gold processing in Peru causes an annual loss of 362.47 tons of mercury. The region of Madre de Dios, where alluvial mining is practiced, concentrates the largest production of gold in ASM and the largest emissions and releases of mercury (181 tons of mercury), which represents 50\% of the national total, followed by Arequipa and Puno with 21.9 and 17.8\% respectively. Mercury losses occur during the preparation of the amalgam and its burning and are influenced by the type of deposit, the characteristics of the raw ore, the exploitation and benefit methods, and the experience of the operators. In all cases, it has been found that the use of mercury recovery systems such as retorts is very limited and does not have a significant impact on production. The great diversity of mining sites and processing methods means that there is great variability in the ratio of mercury loss to the amount of gold produced, for example the lowest value (2.1:1) was found in the Huepethue area in Madre de Dios with the use of mechanized methods (shute and front loader), while the highest loss ratio was found in Cháparra and Arequipa with the use of quimbaletes (8.7:1). The sector called La Pampa in Madre de Dios is the main source of emissions and releases with 40\% of the national total (145 tons), followed by Rinconada in Puno with 13\% (46 tons) and Secocha in Arequipa with 8\%. (27.8 tons).},

Most, however, operate without the requisite permits to mine legally due to a shortage of untitled  land, as well as bureaucratic and costly registration processes.  This article contributes to this discussion, drawing on fresh evidence from Ghana, the location of one of the largest and most  dynamic ASM economies in sub-Saharan Africa.  Here, it is explained, there is a sizable gap between what the government believes ASM is, and what it actually is.  This misdiagnosis has spawned a regulatory apparatus that has proved to be a formidable barrier for ASM operators who are attempting to transition to the formal economy.  But rather than highlighting this oversight, the media, government officials and donors have focused mainly on the negative aspects of the sector that policy has ‘created’, including its environmental footprint, poor health and safety record, and numerous social ‘ills’.  The attention paid to these ‘expressions’ of ASM’s  informality and its unsustainable growth trajectory could potentially derail efforts to formalize a sector which, if adequately supported, could catalyze much-needed economic development in one of the world’s poorest regions.},

	abstract = {Alluvial gold mining activities in the Peruvian Amazon rainforest are responsible for mercury emissions and deforestation. To understand related environmental impacts, specifically toxicity and climate change, this study uses Life Cycle Assessment methodology. Four predominant extraction systems were selected and modelled and three scenarios that reflect currently available gold recovery systems were modelled: amalgamation, amalgamation with mercury recovery through retort system and gravimetric tables. The USEtox and IPCC life cycle impact assessment methods were used to assess the environmental impacts in term of human toxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity and climate change. Results show that for all systems, human toxicity values are governed by mercury emissions in gold recovery activities (ca. 80\%). However, the use of retort significantly lowers these impacts (ca. 90\%). Machines and diesel use for ore extraction and freighting activities drive freshwater ecotoxicity. Moreover, deforestation has a major contribution on the environmental impacts related to climate change. However, these impacts are dependent on the type of extraction system. Although human toxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity and climate change are frequently studied separately, a direct relationship between them has been identified in this system. Finally, beyond the environmental burdens related to alluvial gold mining, there are impacts affecting the social, cultural, and economic dimensions that will need to be analyzed to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the system.},

However, estimates of global atmospheric Se fluxes are highly uncertain. To constrain these uncertainties, we use a global model of atmospheric Se cycling and a database of more than 600 sites where Se in aerosol has been measured. Applying Bayesian inference techniques, we determine the probability distributions of global Se emissions from the four major sources: anthropogenic activities, volcanoes, marine biosphere, and terrestrial biosphere. Between 29 and 36 Gg of Se are emitted to the atmosphere every year, doubling previous estimates of emissions. Using emission parameters optimized by aerosol network measurements, our model shows good agreement with the aerosol Se observations (R2 = 0.66), as well as with independent aerosol (0.59) and wet deposition measurements (0.57). Both model and measurements show a decline in Se over North America in the last two decades because of changes in technology and energy policy. Our results highlight the role of the ocean as a net atmospheric Se sink, with around 7 Gg yr–1 of Se transferred from land through the atmosphere. The constrained Se emissions represent a substantial step forward in understanding the global Se cycle.},

While scholars have focused on examining the viability of formalization itself, little is known about the outcomes once ASGM operations become formal, or whether formalization efforts are sustainable. Peru has made great strides on simplifying the formalization process and has formalized over 9600 artisanal miners. Drawing on a case study from one of these formalized operations, this research examines postformalization outcomes. Findings from interviews with government officials and members of the ASGM community in one of the most important ASGM regions of Peru, Puno, demonstrate that formalization has yielded mixed results. Formal ASGM operations have improved health and safety practices and labor conditions, and miners believe their environmental awareness has increased. Despite these changes, miners who have become formalized feel even more pursued and scrutinized than they did when they operated informally, and they continue to face challenges obtaining technical support and accessing capital. We argue that although some progress has been made in formalization efforts, the problems and weaknesses within the approach may inadvertently push miners back into informality.We conclude that in order for formalization to be more fruitful for governments and miners, governments working on formalizing ASGM activities would greatly benefit from the creation of a solid postformalization strategy focused on educating and supporting formal ASGM operations.},

This study analyzes global and regional trends in anthropogenic Hg releases to the atmosphere between 2010 and 2015, as well as the associated trends in modeled and measured Hg concentrations at sites around the world. In general, we find that global Hg emissions and concentrations have grown slightly in this period, as declines from the phase-out of commercial Hg use in the developed world have been more than matched by increases in Hg-related activities in the industrializing countries of the world. We estimate that global Hg emissions between 2010 and 2015 have grown at a rate of 1.8\%/yr, from 2188 Mg (+44\%/-20\%, 80\% C.I.) in 2010 to 2390 Mg (+42\%/-19\%, 80\% C.I.) in 2015. Regionally, emissions declined over this period in the U.S. (−10\%), OECD Europe (−5.8\%), and Canada (−3.2\%), while they increased in Central America (+5.4\%), South Asia (+4.6\%), and Eastern Africa (+4.0\%). East Asia remained the largest emitting region at 1012 Mg in 2015, though growth there has slowed significantly in recent years. The production of Hg (+7.9\%), caustic soda (+6.3\%), and cement (+6.3\%) showed the highest increases by source type, though artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) was the single largest source of emissions in 2015 (775 Mg). The commercial use of Hg in dental applications (−5.6\%) and electrical equipment (−5.2\%) continued to decline. These emission trends show a continuation of the regional and sectoral shifts that began in the 1970s, but with a resulting reversal in global trends, because the benefits from Hg phase-out in North America and Europe have been largely realized and industrial growth in developing countries has begun to dominate. The emission trends are in agreement with trends in modeled and measured concentrations, which show small declines in surface air total gaseous Hg concentrations in eastern North America and Western Europe between 2010 and 2015, but slight increases for much of the rest of the world, driven by the continued increases in emissions from Asia and from ASGM. Our results suggest that reductions of Hg in the North Atlantic region have been largely successful, and focus now needs to shift to Asia and to the continued practice of ASGM worldwide.},

The purpose was to evaluate the accuracy of the PAS vis-à-vis the industry standard active instruments and to determine a sampling rate (SR; the volume of air stripped of gaseous Hg per unit of time) that is applicable across a wide range of conditions. The sites spanned a wide range of latitudes, altitudes, meteorological conditions, and gaseous Hg concentrations.

When concentrations are derived from the PAS using this revised SR the difference between concentrations from active and passive sampling is reduced to 8.{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{8}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;7.{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{5}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;\%. At the mean gaseous Hg concentration across the study sites of 1.54\&thinsp;ng\&thinsp;m{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−3}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, this represents an ability to resolve concentrations to within 0.13\&thinsp;ng\&thinsp;m{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−3}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}. Adjusting the sampling rate to deployment specific temperatures and wind speeds does not decrease the difference in active–passive concentration further (8.{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{7}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;5.{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{7}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;\%), but reduces its variability by leading to better agreement in Hg concentrations measured at sites with very high and very low temperatures and very high wind speeds. This value (8.{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{7}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;5.{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{7}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;\%) represents a conservative assessment of the overall uncertainty of the PAS due to inherent uncertainties of the Tekran instruments. Going forward, the recalibrated SR adjusted for temperature and wind speed should be used, especially if conditions are highly variable or deviate considerably from the average of the deployments in this study (9.8{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{9}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C, 3.4{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;m\&thinsp;s{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}$){\textless}/span{\textgreater}. Overall, the study demonstrates that the sampler is capable of recording background gaseous Hg concentrations across a wide range of environmental conditions with accuracy similar to that of industry standard active sampling instruments. Results at sites with active speciation units were inconclusive on whether the PASs take up total gaseous Hg or solely gaseous elemental Hg primarily because gaseous oxidized Hg concentrations were in a similar range as the uncertainty of the PAS.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {While much is known about voluntary sustainability standards' contributions to certain issues in certain sectors, less is known about their contributions to the realization of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper helps balance the literature via comparative analysis of the contributions of two voluntary sustainability certification programs for artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) run by Fairtrade International and the Alliance for Responsible Mining. Assessment of four indicators of contribution strength (SDG alignment, rule stringency, uptake patterns, indirect effects) suggest weak to moderate contributions to date. First, only the weakest versions of standards are being adopted and only by miners above the poverty line prior to certification. Second, adoption levels are low, and rates of decertification quite high. Third, indirect effects on consumers and public actors are equally weak. Yet programs do align well with the SDGs. To improve, programs should consider uniting, becoming more “producer friendly,” and decide which role within SDG and ASGM governance regimes they are best suited to play (which may be none at all). Findings contribute to debates on the merits of increasing global governance fragmentation and the role transnationalism in global problem-solving. The understudied ASGM case provides lessons about the diffusion of certification to new sectors, with the aim of guiding global resources towards their most efficient and effective ends.},

The models were compared between each other and with available measurements from 11 monitoring stations of the EMEP measurement network. Because only a very limited number of long-term measurement records of Hg were available, significant attention was given to the intercomparison of modelling results. Monthly and annually averaged values of Hg concentrations and depositions as well as items of the Hg deposition budgets for individual European countries were compared. The models demonstrated good agreement (within +/-20\%) between annual modelled and observed values of gaseous elemental Hg. Modelled values of Hg wet deposition in Western and Central Europe agreed with the observations within +/-45\%. The probability to predict wet depositions within a factor of 2 with regard to measurements was 50-70\% for all the models. The scattering of modelling results for dry depositions of Hg was more significant (up to +/-50\% at the annual scale and even higher for monthly data). Contribution of dry deposition to the total Hg deposition was estimated at 20-30\% with elevated dry deposition fluxes during summer time. The participating models agree in their predictions of transboundary pollution for individual countries within +/-60\% at the monthly scale and within +/-30\% at the annual scale. For the cases investigated, all the models predict that the major part of national anthropogenic Hg emissions is transported outside the country territory.},

Though Integrated Assessments have been used in the fields of environmental science and sustainable development, their use in addressing specific matter in public health, and in particular, environmental and occupational health is quite limited despite their many benefits. The aim of the current paper was to describe specific activities undertaken and how they were organized, and the outputs and outcomes of our activity. In brief, three disciplinary workgroups (Natural Sciences, Human Health, Social Sciences and Economics) were formed, with 26 researchers from a range of Ghanaian institutions plus international experts. The workgroups conducted activities in order to address the following question: What are the causes, consequences and correctives of small-scale gold mining in Ghana? More specifically: What alternatives are available in resource-limited settings in Ghana that allow for gold-mining to occur in a manner that maintains ecological health and human health without hindering near- and long-term economic prosperity? Several response options were identified and evaluated, and are currently being disseminated to various stakeholders within Ghana and internationally.},

	abstract = {Many reports have been written about the issues surrounding small scale miners’ challenges in Namibia; yet little has been done to address these challenges. There has been a fragmented approach to address these challenges. Various government arms and donororganizationshave utilizedpiece meal methods in the past in trying to make improvements on the productivities across the sector, but with no meaningful success.This has led to the design and implementation of inappropriate technologies and support services for the sector. The structures of many of the semi-precious stones mining businesses are informal, with very little royalties received by the government. Miners often work informally or illegally andthey fear government interference and they distrustoutsiders, resulting in them withholding production information. The presence of small scale miners is quite often associated with major challenges, including poor safety and environmental management standards, the spread of communicable diseases and poorworking conditions. The majority of the miners employ uncontrolled extraction techniques which damage the crystals and mineral specimens, resulting in intermediate and final products of low quality along with high wastage at the extraction stage. The vision of the Namibian government is to expand the range and value of semi-precious stones and jewelryproducts processed within Namibia, while curbing illicit flows of raw stones. This will simultaneously secure maximum benefit for the country. This study investigated the interventions aimed at making the small scale mining sector in Namibia sustainable. A baseline study was conducted to analyzethe current situation and characterizethe industry, including a SWOT analysis. Information was collected through questionnaires, interviews, consultative meetings, field visits and workshops in order to profile the sector. The baseline study results were used in developing interventions for improving artisanal and small scale mining operations. The main challenges for the Namibian semi-precious sector were identified as: factual information about raw material resources and its beneficiation are insufficient or not available, lack of skills, lack of education and access to finances, rudimentary exploration and mining practices, trading and logistics that are not functioning effectively and inadequate sector governance. One key finding of this study was that Namibia is not benefiting through value addition due partly to illicit flows of the uncut stones and to the fact that lapidary is not much pronounced to a greater extent. The following strategic interventions were identified as key in ensuring the sustainability of the small mining sector in Namibia:conducting geological assessment to identify new deposits and quantify the existing ones, improving exploration and mining practices, investing in education and training, creating an enabling environment and improving the sector governance and strengthening the sector organizationand supporting the infrastructure.},

To assess the effectiveness of the convention in the future, better constraints about the current mercury emissions is a premise. In our study, we applied a top-down approach to quantify mercury emissions on the basis of atmospheric mercury measurements conducted at the remote high altitude monitoring station Jungfraujoch, Switzerland. We established the source-receptor relationships and by the means of atmospheric inversion we were able to quantify spatially resolved European emissions of 89 ± 14 t/a for elemental mercury. Our European emission estimate is 17\% higher than the bottom-up emission inventory, which is within stated uncertainties. However, some regions with unexpectedly high emissions were identified. Stationary combustion, in particular in coal-fired power plants, is found to be the main responsible sector for increased emission estimates. Our top-down approach, based on measurements, provides an independent constraint on mercury emissions, helps to improve and refine reported emission inventories, and can serve for continued assessment of future changes in emissions independent from bottom-up inventories.},

Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining (ASGM) has been identified as the most important anthropogenic source of Hg at a global scale and an important route of human exposure to Hg. In this context, this study assessed total Hg (THg) in blood, urine and hair, and methylmercury (MeHg) in human hair samples from 238 participants with occupational exposure to Hg in the most relevant ASGM communities of Colombia. Mercury concentrations in different biological matrices were related to several variables of interest such as age, gender, body mass index, fish consumption, exposure time, and specific occupational activities, such as amalgamation and amalgam burning. The median values of THg in blood (3.70 µg/L), urine (4.00 µg/L) and hair (1.37 mg/kg), and hair MeHg (1.47 mg/kg) for all participants were below permissible concentrations set by WHO. However, about 40\% of the miners showed Hg concentrations in blood, urine and/or hair above the WHO thresholds. In all the biological matrices studied, miners burning amalgams showed significantly higher concentrations than miners who did not burn amalgams, with values 7-, 7-, and 8-fold higher in blood, urine and hair, respectively. A multiple linear regression model revealed that burning amalgam and fish consumption were significant predictors of Hg exposure in miners. Miners from Guainía had the highest concentrations in urine and hair, most likely due to the high manipulation and burning of amalgam, and a high fish consumption. In contrast, miners from Caldas showed the lowest Hg concentrations in all the biomarkers because they do not manipulate or burn amalgam, as well as reporting the lowest fish consumption. Our study also highlighted that gold miners exposure to Hg depends on their work practices. Therefore, the implementation of a health education programme on gold mining strategies is required, especially in Guaina, Vaupés, Córdoba, and Antioquia departments.},

Approximately 15 million people, including approximately 3 million women and children, participate in artisanal small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in developing countries. Thirty-seven percent of global air emissions of Hg are produced by ASGM. The recently adopted Minamata Convention calls for nations to gather health data, train health-care workers, and raise awareness in regard to ASGM activity., Objective: The purpose of our review was to evaluate the current literature regarding the health effects of Hg among those working and/or living in or near ASGM communities., Methods: We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar for studies relating to health effects and biomarkers of Hg exposure in ASGM communities. Articles published from 1990 through December 2012 were evaluated for relevance., Discussion: Studies reporting health assessments, kidney dysfunction, neurological disorders and symptoms, and immunotoxicity/autoimmune dysfunction in individuals living in or near an ASGM community were identified. More than 60 studies that measured biomarkers of Hg exposure in individuals living in or near ASGM communities were also identified. These studies, conducted in 19 different countries in South America, Asia, and Africa, demonstrated that hair and urine concentrations are well above World Health Organization health guidance values in ASGM communities., Conclusions: ASGM workers and their families are exposed to Hg vapor, and workers, workers’ families, and residents of nearby and downstream communities are consuming fish heavily contaminated with methylmercury., Citation: Gibb H, O’Leary KG. 2014.

	abstract = {Ratification of the Minamata Convention on Mercury has led to the establishment of Peruvian regulations limiting mercury concentrations in air to 2000 ng/m3over a 24-hr measurement period. As a result, three communities in Madre de Dios, Peru were mapped during October 2017 to determine Hg0 vapor concentrations in the air. The town of Tres Islas exhibited Hg0 concentrations less than 200 ng/m3: the minimum risk level defined by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. These low concentrations were reflective of a town in the region with limited exposure to artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM). However, the ASGM communities of Laberinto and Delta One exhibited concentrations of Hg0 vapor that exceeded 2,000,000 ng/m3 surrounding active gold shops, where amalgams and processed amalgams were heated with open flames. Laberinto was reevaluated in May 2018 during which time Hg0 levels on the sidewalks in front of gold shops again exceeded 2,000,000 ng/m3. Within the scope of this paper a rapid mapping technique allows for the detection of sources of Hg0 pollution and identifies neighborhoods that require intervention to decrease Hg0 emissions. In addition, this work highlights the difficulties of measuring total gaseous mercury in ASGM communities with gold shops according to the Peruvian law.},

One clear evidence is the fact that over 90 national reports on the progress in implementation had been received, reflecting a rate of nearly 80\% for the reporting period. This strong reporting rate is a proof that the pandemic is not a burden to our collective commitment to eliminate mercury. There are several pending issues which will be discussed at COP-4, including the review of Annexes A and B to the Convention, dental amalgam, custom codes, releases of mercury, mercury waste thresholds, and effectiveness 
evaluation of the Convention. Currently, experts from various regions work hard under three intersessional working groups schemes (review of annexes, mercury releases and mercury waste) to prepare draft documents to implement the Convention in more practical ways. Parties and observers will have the opportunity to contribute to these documents before COP-4.},

	abstract = {We review recent progress in our understanding of the global cycling of mercury (Hg), including best estimates of Hg concentrations and pool sizes in major environmental compartments and exchange processes within and between these reservoirs. Recent advances include the availability of new global datasets covering areas of the world where environmental Hg data were previously lacking; integration of these data into global and regional models is continually improving estimates of global Hg cycling. New analytical techniques, such as Hg stable isotope characterization, provide novel constraints of sources and transformation processes. The major global Hg reservoirs that are, and continue to be, affected by anthropogenic activities include the atmosphere (4.4–5.3 Gt), terrestrial environments (particularly soils: 250–1000 Gg), and aquatic ecosystems (e.g., oceans: 270–450 Gg). Declines in anthropogenic Hg emissions between 1990 and 2010 have led to declines in atmospheric Hg0 concentrations and HgII wet deposition in Europe and the US (− 1.5 to − 2.2\% per year). Smaller atmospheric Hg0 declines (− 0.2\% per year) have been reported in high northern latitudes, but not in the southern hemisphere, while increasing atmospheric Hg loads are still reported in East Asia. New observations and updated models now suggest high concentrations of oxidized HgII in the tropical and subtropical free troposphere where deep convection can scavenge these HgII reservoirs. As a result, up to 50\% of total global wet HgII deposition has been predicted to occur to tropical oceans. Ocean Hg0 evasion is a large source of present-day atmospheric Hg (approximately 2900 Mg/year; range 1900–4200 Mg/year). Enhanced seawater Hg0 levels suggest enhanced Hg0 ocean evasion in the intertropical convergence zone, which may be linked to high HgII deposition. Estimates of gaseous Hg0 emissions to the atmosphere over land, long considered a critical Hg source, have been revised downward, and most terrestrial environments now are considered net sinks of atmospheric Hg due to substantial Hg uptake by plants. Litterfall deposition by plants is now estimated at 1020–1230 Mg/year globally. Stable isotope analysis and direct flux measurements provide evidence that in many ecosystems Hg0 deposition via plant inputs dominates, accounting for 57–94\% of Hg in soils. Of global aquatic Hg releases, around 50\% are estimated to occur in China and India, where Hg drains into the West Pacific and North Indian Oceans. A first inventory of global freshwater Hg suggests that inland freshwater Hg releases may be dominated by artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM; approximately 880 Mg/year), industrial and wastewater releases (220 Mg/year), and terrestrial mobilization (170–300 Mg/year). For pelagic ocean regions, the dominant source of Hg is atmospheric deposition; an exception is the Arctic Ocean, where riverine and coastal erosion is likely the dominant source. Ocean water Hg concentrations in the North Atlantic appear to have declined during the last several decades but have increased since the mid-1980s in the Pacific due to enhanced atmospheric deposition from the Asian continent. Finally, we provide examples of ongoing and anticipated changes in Hg cycling due to emission, climate, and land use changes. It is anticipated that future emissions changes will be strongly dependent on ASGM, as well as energy use scenarios and technology requirements implemented under the Minamata Convention. We predict that land use and climate change impacts on Hg cycling will be large and inherently linked to changes in ecosystem function and global atmospheric and ocean circulations. Our ability to predict multiple and simultaneous changes in future Hg global cycling and human exposure is rapidly developing but requires further enhancement.},

Ghana is currently confronted with pollution of its main water bodies, which has reduced the supply of good quality water to the populace. To address these problems, several attempts - policy formulation, formalisation and introduction of technical assistance - have been undertaken by the government of Ghana and other international bodies such as United Nations Industrial Development Organisation-UNIDO. Despite these attempts, majority of artisanal small-scale miners are not registered and even some registered miners together with unregistered miners indulge in unacceptable mining practices. Premised on these, the study sought to undertake a thorough review of the challenges associated with the management of ASM in Ghana and provide a framework for the effective management of the sector. Consequently, a three-pronged approach (problem analysis, planning and implementation and enforcement) with a cross-cutting focus on monitoring and evaluation is recommended.},

	abstract = {In support of international efforts to reduce mercury (Hg) exposure in humans and wildlife, this paper reviews the literature concerning global Hg emissions, cycling and fate, and presents revised global and oceanic Hg budgets for the 2018 United Nations Global Mercury Assessment. We assessed two competing scenarios about the impacts of 16th – late 19th century New World silver (Ag) mining, which may be the largest human source of atmospheric Hg in history. Consideration of Ag ore geochemistry, historical documents on Hg use, and comparison of the scenarios against atmospheric Hg patterns in environmental archives, strongly support a “low mining emission” scenario. Building upon this scenario and other published work, the revised global budget estimates human activities including recycled legacy emissions have increased current atmospheric Hg concentrations by about 450\% above natural levels (prevailing before 1450 AD). Current anthropogenic emissions to air are 2.5 ± 0.5 kt/y. The increase in atmospheric Hg concentrations has driven a ∼ 300\% average increase in deposition, and a 230\% increase in surface marine waters. Deeper marine waters show increases of only 12–25\%. The overall increase in Hg in surface organic soils (∼15\%) is small due to the large mass of natural Hg already present from rock weathering, but this figure varies regionally. Specific research recommendations are made to reduce uncertainties, particularly through improved understanding of fundamental processes of the Hg cycle, and continued improvements in emissions inventories from large natural and anthropogenic sources.},

	abstract = {Abstract We compare atmospheric temperature changes in satellite data and in model ensembles performed under phases 5 and 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 and CMIP6). In the lower stratosphere, multidecadal stratospheric cooling during the period of strong ozone depletion is smaller in newer CMIP6 simulations than in CMIP5 or satellite data. In the troposphere, however, despite forcing and climate sensitivity differences between the two CMIP ensembles, their ensemble-average global warming over 1979–2019 is very similar. We also examine four properties of tropical behavior governed by basic physical processes. The first three are ratios between trends in water vapor (WV) and trends in sea surface temperature (SST), lower-tropospheric temperature (TLT), and mid- to upper-tropospheric temperature (TMT). The fourth property is the ratio between TMT and SST trends. All four ratios are tightly constrained in CMIP simulations but diverge markedly in observations. Model trend ratios between WV and temperature are closest to observed ratios when the latter are calculated with datasets exhibiting larger tropical warming of the ocean surface and troposphere. For the TMT/SST ratio, model–data consistency depends on the combination of observations used to estimate TMT and SST trends. If model expectations of these four covariance relationships are realistic, our findings reflect either a systematic low bias in satellite tropospheric temperature trends or an overestimate of the observed atmospheric moistening signal. It is currently difficult to determine which interpretation is more credible. Nevertheless, our analysis reveals anomalous covariance behavior in several observational datasets and illustrates the diagnostic power of simultaneously considering multiple complementary variables.},

	abstract = {Mercury-dependent artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is the largest source of mercury pollution on Earth. In this practice, elemental mercury is used  to extract gold from ore as an amalgam. The amalgam is typically isolated by hand  and then heated-often with a torch or over a stove-to distill the mercury and  isolate the gold. Mercury release from tailings and vaporized mercury exceed  1000 tonnes each year from ASGM. The health effects on the miners are dire, with  inhaled mercury leading to neurological damage and other health issues. The  communities near these mines are also affected due to mercury contamination of  water and soil and subsequent accumulation in food staples, such as fish-a major  source of dietary protein in many ASGM regions. The risks to children are also  substantial, with mercury emissions from ASGM resulting in both physical and  mental disabilities and compromised development. Between 10 and 19 million people  use mercury to mine for gold in more than 70 countries, making mercury pollution  from ASGM a global issue. With the Minamata Convention on Mercury entering force  this year, there is political motivation to help overcome the problem of mercury  in ASGM. In this effort, chemists can play a central role. Here, the problem of  mercury in ASGM is reviewed with a discussion on how the chemistry community can  contribute solutions. Introducing portable and low-cost mercury sensors,  inexpensive and scalable remediation technologies, novel methods to prevent  mercury uptake in fish and food crops, and efficient and easy-to-use mercury-free  mining techniques are all ways in which the chemistry community can help. To meet  these challenges, it is critical that new technologies or techniques are low-cost  and adaptable to the remote and under-resourced areas in which ASGM is most  common. The problem of mercury pollution in ASGM is inherently a chemistry  problem. We therefore encourage the chemistry community to consider and address  this issue that affects the health of millions of people.},

The recently adopted Minamata Convention calls for nations to gather health data, train health-care workers, and raise awareness in regard to ASGM activity.

Objective: The purpose of our review was to evaluate the current literature regarding the health effects of Hg among those working and/or living in or near ASGM communities.

Methods: We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar for studies relating to health effects and biomarkers of Hg exposure in ASGM communities. Articles published from 1990 through December 2012 were evaluated for relevance.

Discussion: Studies reporting health assessments, kidney dysfunction, neurological disorders and symptoms, and immunotoxicity/autoimmune dysfunction in individuals living in or near an ASGM community were identified. More than 60 studies that measured biomarkers of Hg exposure in individuals living in or near ASGM communities were also identified. These studies, conducted in 19 different countries in South America, Asia, and Africa, demonstrated that hair and urine concentrations are well above World Health Organization health guidance values in ASGM communities.

Conclusions: ASGM workers and their families are exposed to Hg vapor, and workers, workers’ families, and residents of nearby and downstream communities are consuming fish heavily contaminated with methylmercury.

Passive air samplers (PAS) are an accessible method for monitoring gaseous elemental mercury (GEM). I tested the suitability of PAS for recording GEM gradients at widely varying scales. Vertical gradients on the scale of centimeters to tens of meters measured over soil and within a forest allowed for the observation of GEM uptake in growing vegetation, the determination of the air-surface exchange direction, and the estimation of evaporative fluxes from contaminated soil. When PAS were deployed above a field with known soil contamination, slightly different spatial contamination patterns suggest horizontal GEM advection. on a continental scale, the PAS were also used to map annually averaged GEM levels across South and Central America. Accounting for the effect of wind speed on the PAS sampling rate is necessary to distinguish small concentration differences.},

	abstract = {Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is an economic activity with pre-columbian roots in Perú. Today it continues to be practiced throughout the national territory, although it is concentrated in certain regions where ore bodies are most easily exploited. Most ASGM activity takes place informally and even illegally, characterized by large amounts of labour input and simple technologies. In recent years, the high price of gold has caused a significant growth in the sector and drawn increased attention to the issue of mercury used during the processing of gold bearing ores. In 2017, the Artisanal Gold Council conducted a national study to document mercury use in the sector and to develop baseline estimates for ASGM mercury emissions and releases. This study was carried out in partnership with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and with funding by the Global Environment Facility as part of a project to develop a national action plan for the ASGM sector in compliance with article 7 of the Minamata Convention on Mercury. The study relied on the methodology for estimating mercury use in ASGM developed by the Artisanal Gold Council and published as Developing Baseline Estimates for Mercury Use in Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining Communities: A Practical Guide (AGC, 2015). The work focused on the regions of Madre de Dios, Puno, Arequipa and Ayacucho as they account for approximately 94\% of the ASGM gold production in the country. The AGC estimates that approximately 148.77 tons of gold is produced by the Peruvian ASGM sector per year. Of this production 87.97\% is processed through amalgamation with mercury; the remaining 12\% relies primarily on cyanide treatment. The use of mercury in artisanal and small-scale gold mining in Perú results in the loss of 362.47 tons of mercury to the land, air and water annually. The mercury losses occur with the addition of mercury to gold bearing ores to create mercury / gold amalgams. Mercury is further lost to the environment when these amalgams are burned to recover the gold. The amount of mercury used and lost is a function in part of the type of ore deposit, the characteristics of the crude ore, the methods of exploitation and the experience of the operators. In all cases it has been found that the use of mercury recovery systems such as retorts is very limited and does not have a significant impact on overall mercury emissions. The region of Madre de Dios where, alluvial mining is practiced, sees the highest levels of gold production by the national ASGM sector and also the highest levels of emissions and releases of mercury (181 tons annually). This represents 50\% of the national total for mercury emissions and releases. Madre de Dios is followed by Arequipa and Puno with 21.9\% and 17.8\% of the national total of mercury emissions and releases from ASGM respectively. The great diversity of mining sites and processing methods means that there is a great variability in mercury loss ratios with respect to the amount of gold produced, so for example the lowest value (2.1 Hg : 1 Au) was found in the Huepethue area in Madre de Dios with the use of mechanized methods (sluice and frontal loader), while the highest loss ratio was found in Cháparra, Arequipa with the use of quimbaletes (8.7 Hg : 1 Au). The area of La Pampa in Madre de Dios is the main focus of emissions and releases with 40\% of the national total (145 tons annually), followed by Rinconada in Puno with 13\% (46 tons annually) and Secocha in Arequipa with 8\% (27.8 tons annually)},

	abstract = {Retinal degeneration is often progressive. This feature has provided a therapeutic window for intervention that may extend functional vision in patients. Even though this approach is feasible, few promising drug candidates are available. The scarcity of new drugs has motivated research to discover novel compounds through different sources. One such example is Schisandrin B (SchB), an active component isolated from the five-flavor fruit (Fructus Schisandrae) that is postulated in traditional Chinese medicines to exert prophylactic visual benefit. This SchB benefit was investigated in this study in pde6cw59, a zebrafish retinal-degeneration model. In this model, the pde6c gene (phosphodiesterase 6C, cGMP-specific, cone, alpha prime) carried a mutation which caused cone degeneration. This altered the local environment and caused the bystander rods to degenerate too. To test SchB on the pde6cw59 mutants, a treatment concentration was first determined that would not cause morphological defects, and would initiate known physiological response. Then, the mutants were treated with the optimized SchB concentration before the appearance of retinal degeneration at 3 days postfertilization (dpf). The light sensation of animals was evaluated at 6 dpf by the visual motor response (VMR), a visual startle that could be initiated by drastic light onset and offset. The results show that the VMR of pde6cw59 mutants towards light onset was enhanced by the SchB treatment, and that the initial phase of the enhancement was primarily mediated through the mutants’ eyes. Further immunostaining analysis indicates that the treatment specifically reduced the size of the abnormally large rods. These observations implicate an interesting hypothesis: that the morphologically-improved rods drive the observed VMR enhancement. Together, these investigations have identified a possible visual benefit of SchB on retinal degeneration, a benefit that can potentially be further developed to extend functional vision in patients.},

	abstract = {We use a global 3-D model of atmospheric mercury (GEOS-Chem) to interpret worldwide observations of total gaseous mercury (TGM) and reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) in terms of the constraints they provide on the chemical cycling and deposition of mercury. Our simulation including a global mercury source of 7000 Mg yr−1 and a TGM lifetime of 0.8 years reproduces the magnitude and large-scale variability of TGM observations at land sites. However, it cannot capture observations of high TGM from ship cruises, implying a problem either in the measurements or in our fundamental understanding of mercury sources. Observed TGM seasonal variation at northern midlatitudes is consistent with a photochemical oxidation for Hg(0) partly balanced by photochemical reduction of Hg(II). Observations of increasing RGM with altitude imply a long lifetime of Hg(II) in the free troposphere. We find in the model that Hg(II) dominates over Hg(0) in the upper troposphere and stratosphere and that subsidence is the principal source of Hg(II) at remote surface sites. RGM observations at Okinawa Island (Japan) show large diurnal variability implying fast deposition, which we propose is due to RGM uptake by sea-salt aerosols. Observed mercury wet deposition fluxes in the United States show a maximum in the southeast, which we attribute to photochemical oxidation of the global Hg(0) pool. They also show a secondary maximum in the industrial Midwest due to regional emissions that is underestimated in the model, possibly because of excessive dry deposition relative to wet (dry deposition accounts for 68\% of total mercury deposition in the United States in the model, but this is sensitive to the assumed phase of Hg(II)). We estimate that North American anthropogenic emissions contribute on average 20\% to U.S. mercury deposition.},

	abstract = {We develop a mechanistic representation of land-atmosphere cycling in a global 3-D ocean-atmosphere model of mercury (GEOS-Chem). The resulting land-ocean-atmosphere model is used to construct preindustrial and present biogeochemical cycles of mercury, to examine the legacy of past anthropogenic emissions, to map anthropogenic enrichment factors for deposition, and to attribute mercury deposition in the United States. Land emission in the model includes prompt recycling of recently deposited mercury (600 Mg a−1 for present day), soil volatilization (550 Mg a−1), and evapotranspiration (550 Mg a−1). The spatial distribution of soil concentrations is derived from local steady state between land emission and deposition in the preindustrial simulation, augmented for the present day by a 15\% increase in the soil reservoir distributed following the pattern of anthropogenic deposition. Mercury deposition and hence emission are predicted to be highest in the subtropics. Our atmospheric lifetime of mercury against deposition (0.50 year) is shorter than past estimates because of our accounting of Hg(0) dry deposition, but recycling from surface reservoirs results in an effective lifetime of 1.6 years against transfer to long-lived reservoirs in the soil and deep ocean. Present-day anthropogenic enrichment of mercury deposition exceeds a factor of 5 in continental source regions. We estimate that 68\% of the deposition over the United States is anthropogenic, including 20\% from North American emissions (20\% primary and {\textless}1\% recycled through surface reservoirs), 31\% from emissions outside North America (22\% primary and 9\% recycled), and 16\% from the legacy of anthropogenic mercury accumulated in soils and the deep ocean.},

	abstract = {We present a first description and evaluation of GEOS-CHEM, a global threedimensional (3-D) model of tropospheric chemistry driven by assimilated meteorological observations from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) of the NASA Data Assimilation Office (DAO). The model is applied to a 1-year simulation of tropospheric ozone-NOx-hydrocarbon chemistry for 1994, and is evaluated with observations both for 1994 and for other years. It reproduces usually to within 10 ppb the concentrations of ozone observed from the worldwide ozonesonde data network. It simulates correctly the seasonal phases and amplitudes of ozone concentrations for different regions and altitudes, but tends to underestimate the seasonal amplitude at northern midlatitudes. Observed concentrations of NO and peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) observed in aircraft campaigns are generally reproduced to within a factor of 2 and often much better. Concentrations of HNO3 in the remote troposphere are overestimated typically by a factor of 2–3, a common problem in global models that may reflect a combination of insufficient precipitation scavenging and gas-aerosol partitioning not resolved by the model. The model yields an atmospheric lifetime of methylchloroform (proxy for global OH) of 5.1 years, as compared to a best estimate from observations of 5.5 +/− 0.8 years, and simulates H2O2 concentrations observed from aircraft with significant regional disagreements but no global bias. The OH concentrations are ∼20\% higher than in our previous global 3-D model which included an UV-absorbing aerosol. Concentrations of CO tend to be underestimated by the model, often by 10–30 ppb, which could reflect a combination of excessive OH (a 20\% decrease in model OH could be accommodated by the methylchloroform constraint) and an underestimate of CO sources (particularly biogenic). The model underestimates observed acetone concentrations over the South Pacific in fall by a factor of 3; a missing source from the ocean may be implicated.},

          , 
            
              Mercury (Hg), a neurotoxic heavy metal, is transferred to marine and terrestrial ecosystems through atmospheric transport. Recent studies have highlighted the role of vegetation uptake as a sink for atmospheric elemental mercury (Hg

To constrain this sink, we compare simulations in the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem with a compiled database of litterfall, throughfall, and flux tower measurements from 93 forested sites. The prior version of GEOS-Chem predicts median Hg
              0
              dry deposition velocities similar to litterfall measurements from Northern hemisphere temperate and boreal forests (∼0.03 cm s

              0.07 cm s

In an illustrative worst-case scenario where the Amazon is completely converted to savannah, GEOS-Chem predicts that an additional 283 Mg Hg per year would deposit to the ocean, where it can bioaccumulate in the marine food chain. Biosphere–atmosphere interactions thus play a crucial role in global Hg cycling and should be considered in assessments of future Hg pollution.},

We selected only the most relevant articles from the thousands of articles that were generated by the Divine Word University (DWU) electronic data base system for our review. Further screening questions were applied based on the CASP method which filtered remaining 105 to only 9 papers for the review. The results from the nine (N = 9) studies analysed showed convincing results of the association between consumption of fish contaminated with methyl mercury and poor growth and development in children whose parents lived near mining sites. We conclude that since mercury is the predominant element used in the extraction of gold in alluvial mining, it is an exposure pathway for methyl mercury toxicity for children through dietary exposure.},

	abstract = {The enormous increase in practically unregulated mining in Madre de Dios Peru is leading to massive release of liquid elemental mercury to the environment. Rapidly increasing global prices for gold are causing a massive upsurge in artisanal mining in the Peruvian Amazon, considered to be one of the most biodiverse places on the planet. This study identifies the current levels of mercury in the human population, through identifying levels of total mercury in human hair in mining zones of Madre de Dios Department and in the nearby city of Puerto Maldonado. A regression analysis reveals that fish consumption, gender, and location of residence were significant indicators of mercury levels; while duration of residence and age had no significant relationship to mercury levels. Increased fish consumption levels were the strongest indicators of increased total mercury levels across the entire population. The levels of total mercury in hair was significantly (a = 0.05) higher in mining zones, than Puerto Maldonado. In both areas men had significantly higher levels than women, likely due to a difference in metabolism or varying levels of direct involvement in gold mining- a male predominated industry. This is the first study to show the health threat that mercury poses to this region, however further research needs to be done to gain a more refined understanding of the predominant routes of exposure in this population.},

Managing boundaries between disciplines, across scales of geography and jurisdiction, and between different forms of knowledge is also often critical to transferring information. The research presented in this paper finds that information requires three (not mutually exclusive) attributes – salience, credibility, and legitimacy – and that what makes boundary crossing difficult is that actors on different sides of a boundary perceive and value salience, credibility, and legitimacy differently. Presenting research on water management regimes in the United States, international agricultural research systems, El Niño forecasting systems in the Pacific and southern Africa, and fisheries in the North Atlantic, this paper explores: 1) how effective boundary work involves creating salient, credible, and legitimate information simultaneously for multiple audiences; 2) the thresholds, complementarities and tradeoffs between salience, credibility, and legitimacy when crossing boundaries; and 3) propositions for institutional mechanisms in boundary organizations which effectively balance tradeoffs, take advantage on complementarities, and reach thresholds of salience, credibility, and legitimacy.},

The adjoint computes the sensitivity of ozone concentrations at the receptor sites to ozone production rates at 2° × 2.5° resolution over the history of air parcels reaching the site. MBO experiences distinct Asian ozone pollution episodes; most of the ozone production in these episodes takes place over East Asia with maxima over northeast China and southern Japan, adding to a diffuse background production distributed over the extratropical northern hemisphere. TH shows the same Asian origins for ozone as MBO but no distinct Asian pollution episodes. We find that transpacific pollution plumes transported in the free troposphere are diluted by a factor of 3 when entrained into the boundary layer, explaining why these plumes are undetectable in U.S. surface air.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric transport models can be used to infer surface fluxes of atmospheric CO2 from observed concentrations using inverse methods. One of the main problem of these methods is the question of their sensivity to all the parameters involved in the calculation. In this paper we study precisely the influence of the main parameters on the net CO2 fluxes inferred by an annual Bayesian three-dimensional (3-D) inversion of atmospheric CO2 monthly concentrations. This inversion is described as the control inversion (S0) of Bousquet et al. [this issue]. Successively, at regional to global spatial scales we analyze the numerical stability of the solution to initial fluxes and errors, the influence of a priori flux scenario, the sensitivity to the atmospheric transport model used, the influence of δ13C measurements, and the influence of the atmospheric network. We find that the atmospheric transport model introduces a large uncertainty to the inferred budget, which overcomes our control run uncertainties. The effects of vertical transport on CO2 concentrations appear to be a critical point that has to be investigated further. Spatial patterns of fluxes also have significant influence on a regional basis. We notice that accounting for the Baltic Sea station (BAL) deeply modifies the Europe versus Asia partition of the land uptake at mid and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. We also analyze the weak influence of using δ13C measurements as additional constraints. In the tropics we find that the low level of constraints imposed by the atmospheric network limits the analysis of fluxes to zonal means. Finally, we calculate overall estimates of CO2 net sources and sinks at continental scale, accounting for all sensivity tests. Concerning the controversial partition of CO2 sink at mid and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, we find (on average, for the 1985–1995 period) an overall partition of the sink of 0.7±0.7 Gt C yr1 for North America, 0.2±0.3 Gt C yr−1 for the North Pacific Ocean, 0.5±0.8 Gt C yr−1 for Europe, 0.7±0.3 Gt C yr−1 for the North Atlantic Ocean, and 1.2±0.8 Gt C yr−1 for north Asia. This overall partition tends to place an important land uptake over north Asia. However, uncertainties remain large when we account for all the sensitivity tests.},

A box model analysis shows that future global biogeochemical cycling under projected technological provisions would result mainly in avoided increases and that estimated differences in atmospheric concentrations resulting from policies would be on the order of 1\% to 2\% per year.

especially for its tropical region. As a consequence, mercury dynamics are still
highly uncertain in this region. This is a significant deficiency, as South America
appears to play a major role in the global budget of this toxic pollutant.
To address this issue, we performed nearly 2 years (July 2014–February 2016) of continuous high-resolution total gaseous mercury (TGM) measurements
at the Chacaltaya (CHC) mountain site in the Bolivian Andes, which is
subject to a diverse mix of air masses coming predominantly from the
Altiplano and the Amazon rainforest. For the first 11 months of
measurements, we obtained a mean TGM concentration of 0.89±0.01 ng m−3, which is in good agreement with the sparse amount of data available from
the continent. For the remaining 9 months, we obtained a significantly
higher TGM concentration of 1.34±0.01 ng m−3, a difference which
we tentatively attribute to the strong El Niño event of 2015–2016.
Based on HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) back trajectories and clustering techniques, we show that
lower mean TGM concentrations were linked to either westerly Altiplanic air
masses or those originating from the lowlands to the southeast of CHC.
Elevated TGM concentrations were related to northerly air masses of
Amazonian or southerly air masses of Altiplanic origin, with the former possibly
linked to artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM), whereas the latter
might be explained by volcanic activity. We observed a marked seasonal
pattern, with low TGM concentrations in the dry season (austral winter),
rising concentrations during the biomass burning (BB) season, and the highest
concentrations at the beginning of the wet season (austral summer). With the
help of simultaneously sampled equivalent black carbon (eBC) and carbon
monoxide (CO) data, we use the clearly BB-influenced signal during the BB season
(August to October) to derive a mean TGM / CO emission ratio of (2.3±0.6)×10-7 ppbvTGM ppbvCO-1, which could be used to
constrain South American BB emissions. Through the link with CO2 measured in situ and remotely sensed solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) as
proxies for vegetation activity, we detect signs of a vegetation sink effect
in Amazonian air masses and derive a “best guess” TGM / CO2 uptake ratio of 0.058 ±0.017 (ng m−3)TGM ppmCO2-1. Finally, significantly
higher Hg concentrations in western Altiplanic air masses during the wet
season compared with the dry season point towards the modulation of
atmospheric Hg by the eastern Pacific Ocean.},

              A global surge in ‘artisanal’, smallscale mining (ASM) threatens biodiverse tropical forests and exposes residents to dangerous levels of mercury. In response, governments and development agencies are investing millions (USD) on ASM
              formalization
              ; registering concessions and demarcating extraction zones to promote regulatory adherence and direct mining away from ecologically sensitive areas. The environmental outcomes of these initiatives are seldom systematically assessed. We examine patterns of mining-related deforestation associated with formalization efforts in a gold-rich region of the Peruvian Amazon. We track changes from 2001 to 2014 when agencies: (a) issued 1701 provisional titles and (b) tried to restrict mining to a {\textgreater}5000 km
              2
              ‘corridor’. We use fixed-effect regression models and matching methods to control for gold price, geology, and accessibility. Mining increased dramatically during this period, clearing ∼40 000 ha of forest. After the mining corridor was declared and enforcement increased, new mining sites were opened more frequently within titled areas and inside the corridor than elsewhere. However, mining also increased in protected area buffer zones and native communities, and the proportion of mining area occurring outside the corridor grew, concentrated in a few hotspots. Interviews (
              n
              = 47) revealed that the hoped-for regulatory adherence failed to materialize because miners who were issued provisional titles started operations without complying with attendant environmental rules. Overlapping land claims for agriculture and forest extraction proved a major obstacle for obtaining full legal rights to mine. Miners resented the slow, costly formalization process but many sought titles to bolster territorial claims, avoid policing, obtain credit and recruit paying ‘guest’ miners who generally ignored regulations. We find that responses to formalization varied with changing context and while formalization may curb mining in some circumstances, it may exacerbate it in others. Without adequate enforcement, interagency coordination, and attention to competing land claims, formalizing ASM may accelerate ecological destruction.},

            Mercury is a globally transported pollutant with potent neurotoxic effects for both humans and wildlife. This study introduces an assessment method to estimate the potential human health-related economic benefits of global and domestic mercury control policies. It finds that for the US population as a whole, global mercury controls could lead to approximately twice the benefits of domestic action by 2050. This result is robust to several uncertainties and variabilities along the emissions-to-impacts path, although we find that those consuming locally caught freshwater fish in the United States could benefit more from domestic action.
          , 
            Mercury pollution poses risks for both human and ecosystem health. As a consequence, controlling mercury pollution has become a policy goal on both global and national scales. We developed an assessment method linking global-scale atmospheric chemical transport modeling to regional-scale economic modeling to consistently evaluate the potential benefits to the United States of global (UN Minamata Convention on Mercury) and domestic [Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS)] policies, framed as economic gains from avoiding mercury-related adverse health endpoints. This method attempts to trace the policies-to-impacts path while taking into account uncertainties and knowledge gaps with policy-appropriate bounding assumptions. We project that cumulative lifetime benefits from the Minamata Convention for individuals affected by 2050 are \$339 billion (2005 USD), with a range from \$1.4 billion to \$575 billion in our sensitivity scenarios. Cumulative economy-wide benefits to the United States, realized by 2050, are \$104 billion, with a range from \$6 million to \$171 billion. Projected Minamata benefits are more than twice those projected from the domestic policy. This relative benefit is robust to several uncertainties and variabilities, with the ratio of benefits (Minamata/MATS) ranging from ≈1.4 to 3. However, we find that for those consuming locally caught freshwater fish from the United States, rather than marine and estuarine fish from the global market, benefits are larger from US than global action, suggesting domestic policies are important for protecting these populations. Per megagram of prevented emissions, our domestic policy scenario results in US benefits about an order of magnitude higher than from our global scenario, further highlighting the importance of domestic action.},

	abstract = {Speciated mercury gridded emissions inventories together with chemical transport models and concentration measurements are essential when investigating both the effectiveness of mitigation measures and the mercury cycle in the environment. Since different mercury species have contrasting behaviour in the atmosphere, their proportion in anthropogenic emissions could determine the spatial impacts. In this study, the time series from 1970 to 2012 of the EDGARv4.tox2 global mercury emissions inventory are described; the total global mercury emission in 2010 is 1772 tonnes. Global grid-maps with geospatial distribution of mercury emissions at a 0.1° × 0.1° resolution are provided for each year. Compared to the previous tox1 version, tox2 provides updates for more recent years and improved emissions in particular for agricultural waste burning, power generation and artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) sectors. We have also developed three retrospective emissions scenarios based on different hypotheses related to the proportion of mercury species in the total mercury emissions for each activity sector; improvements in emissions speciation are seen when using information primarily from field measurements. We evaluated them using the GEOS-Chem 3-D mercury model in order to explore the influence of speciation shifts, to reactive mercury forms in particular, on regional wet deposition patterns. The reference scenario S1 (EDGARv4.tox2\_S1) uses speciation factors from the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP); scenario S2 (“EPA\_power”) uses factors from EPA's Information Collection Request (ICR); and scenario S3 (“Asia\_filedM”) factors from recent scientific publications. In the reference scenario, the sum of reactive mercury emissions (Hg-P and Hg2+) accounted for 25.3\% of the total global emissions; the regions/countries that have shares of reactive mercury emissions higher than 6\% in total global reactive mercury are China+ (30.9\%), India+ (12.5\%) and the United States (9.9\%). In 2010, the variations of reactive mercury emissions amongst the different scenarios are in the range of −19.3 t/yr (China+) to 4.4 t/yr (OECD\_Europe). However, at the sector level, the variation could be different, e.g., for the iron and steel industry in China reaches 15.4 t/yr. Model evaluation at the global level shows a variation of approximately ±10\% in wet deposition for the three emissions scenarios. An evaluation of the impact of mercury speciation within nested grid sensitivity simulations is performed for the United States and modelled wet deposition fluxes are compared with measurements. These studies show that using the S2 and S3 emissions of reactive mercury, can improve wet deposition estimates near sources.},

Although many studies have assessed the human and ecological health impacts of mercury emissions in the vicinity of small-scale mining operations, only a handful have surveyed the source of the contamination: the sites themselves. This paper reports findings from an environmental analysis undertaken directly within three small-scale gold mining sites in Ghana. Using targeted soil and water sampling analysed through mass spectrometry, the findings are compared with findings in the literature and safety guidelines to gauge the scale of contamination at surveyed sites. The analysis reveals that there is widespread pollution, often several orders higher than background levels. Expanding upon this, the results are extrapolated to provide estimates for mercury emissions accountable to the artisanal mining sector for Ghana as a whole.},

	abstract = {The gold ore mined by artisanal and small-scale miners in Portovelo-Zaruma, Ecuador, is processed in custom mills. Miners can choose between Chilean-mill processing centers, where the ore is ground, concentrated and amalgamated, or “Chancha” Centers, where the whole ore is amalgamated. By weighing mercury before and after all unit operations involved in the amalgamation process, it was possible to determine mercury losses. Analyses in eight centers indicated that 51–59\% of mercury introduced into the amalgamation process is recovered when miners squeeze the excess mercury. Around 29\% of total mercury is lost when miners burn amalgam and gold is melted, and 15\% is lost with the tailings. When only gravity concentrates are amalgamated, 1.4\% of mercury entering the process is lost with tailings, whereas 29.5\% is lost when the whole ore is amalgamated. Approximately 1.5 tonnes/annum of mercury is released in Portovelo-Zaruma, from which 70\% is evaporated and 30\% is released with tailings. Mercury-contaminated tailings are leached with cyanide in agitated tanks. A large majority of the processing centers dispose the final tailings with mercury and cyanide into the Calera River and Amarillo River. Mercury dissolved with cyanide likely becomes more bioavailable than metallic mercury. A campaign for reducing mercury emissions must focus on the use of individual retorts – mercury pollution control devices – and the elimination of whole ore amalgamation.},

	abstract = {Small-scale gold mining activities and their mercury emissions in the Gorontalo Utara Regency of the Gorontalo Province, Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, have been studied. The mining occurs in many areas of this region, but especially in the three villages Hulawa, Ilangata and Ilangata Barat. Mining activities in the Hulawa village are the oldest (19th century) in the regency, whereas mining in the Ilangata village began just 15 years ago. The activity level changes rapidly from time to time depending on the fluctuations of the gold market. Women and children are involved in the gold mining process. Female workers crush ore, process sediment wastes, and pan for gold in rivers. Children assist their mothers in these activities and play around the mining sites. Gold mining in the Utara Regency is estimated to produce about 290 kg of gold and emits approximately 860 kg of mercury into the environment annually. The impact of such large mercury release into the environment have caused environmental degradation and contamination of fish as food for humans. Collaborative works of stakeholders are urgently needed to find solutions to the problems related to small-scale gold mining such as marginalization and environmental pollution.},

	abstract = {Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) utilizes mercury (Hg) for the extraction of gold (Au) and is responsible for the largest anthropogenic source of emissions and releases of Hg to the environment. Previous estimates of Hg use in ASGM have varied widely. In this effort, Hg losses in ASGM were derived from the difference between estimates of total Au production and the production reported by conventional gold mining. On the basis of this result, the average ratio of Hg lost to Au produced in ASGM was estimated to be 1.96 in Africa, 4.63 in Latin America, and 1.23 in Asia. The difference among regions can be attributed to the amalgamation procedure used by the miners, in which whole-ore amalgamation is predominant in Latin America and Asia. The obtained estimated ratio of Hglost:Auproduced suggested the possibility to detect either Au or Hg smuggling from one country to another. On the other hand, the importance of considering cyanidation in ASGM was also suggested.},
