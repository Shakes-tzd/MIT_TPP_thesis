\chapter{Optimisation of GEOS-Chem Predictions of Mercury Concentrations in the Atmosphere}
\section{Background}

high Hg emission ASGM Hg emissions can be estimated by leveraging simulations of Hg in the atmosphere generated by the GEOS-Chem model and observation data from long range Hg monitoring stations. By combining our top-down method with existing bottom-up data, we improve estimates of Hg emissions from ASGM activities, using Peru and the Madre de Dios region of South America as case studies.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Modification of Mercury Inventories}

\subsection{Markov Chain Monte Carlo}

\begin{flushleft}
The Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a sampling method that is also useful for fitting models to data\cite{hogg_data_2018}. We apply the MCMC to constrain ASGM Hg emissions from the case study region in Peru.The basic idea behind this approach is to compare the generated models to the data. The model is generated by a set of parameters, emissions, and we aim to sample from the set of parameters that best fits our data. The MCMC is used to compare the modelled concentrations to the observed data using metrics such as the $95^{th}$ confidence interval, mean and the interquartile range. The MCMC generatively models given data by sampling around optimum values from the posterior distribution. The MCMC is a Bayesian approach; hence it requires the definition of priors on the parameters of interest. The priors encode information that we already know of the system. The probability of the model given the observed data is given by the posterior probability, $P(\theta|D)$, which is calculated using the Bayes theorem:

\begin{equation}
\label{bayes_eq}
P(\theta|D)=\frac{P(D|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(D)}
\end{equation}
where:
\end{flushleft}

\begin{description}[leftmargin=!,labelwidth={3 em}]
    \item [$P(D|\theta)$] is the likelihood which is the probability of the data given the model
    \item [$P(\theta)$] is the prior which is the probability of the model and 
    \item [$P(D)$] is the evidence which is the probability of the data.
\end{description}

\begin{flushleft}
The MCMC enables the estimation of the sampling of the posterior distribution which is the left-hand side of Equation~\ref{bayes_eq}. The MCMC is set set up by following a set of steps that include defining a function that outputs a model given a set of input parameters and establishing an ensemble of walkers defined by a $\theta$ vector that contains a set of parameters form the model generating function.For the model generating function the Hg concentration at a particular grid box is defined as a linear combination of Hg concentration signals from the case study region and the baseline Hg concentration as shown in the Equation \ref{Hg_conc} below:

\begin{align}
\begin{split}\label{Hg_conc}
Hg_{conc}= {}&Hg_{m(MdD)}+ Hg_{m(S-Puno)} + Hg_{m(N-Puno)} + Hg_{m(Apr)}+ Hg_{m(Aqp)}\\
            & +Hg_{m_0}
\end{split}
\end{align}

where:
\end{flushleft}

\begin{description}[leftmargin=!,labelwidth={5 em}]
    \item [$Hg_{m(MdD)}$] is the Hg concentration signal resulting from emissions from the Madre de Dios (MdD) grid box
    \item [$Hg_{m(S-Puno)}$] is the Hg concentration signal resulting from emissions from the South Puno (S-Puno) grid box
    \item [$Hg_{m(N-Puno)}$] is the Hg concentration signal resulting from emissions from the North Puno (N-Puno) grid box
    \item [$Hg_{m(Apr)}$] is the Hg concentration signal resulting from emissions from the Apurimac (Apr) grid box
    \item [$Hg_{m(Aqp)}$] is the Hg concentration signal resulting from emissions from the Arequipa (Aqp) grid box
    \item [$Hg_{m_0}$] is the baseline Hg concentration signal.
\end{description}

\begin{flushleft}
Each of the $Hg_{m(region)}$ terms of Equation \ref{Hg_conc} represent signals from the different departments are calculated using Equation~\ref{ysignal}. Equation~\ref{ysignal} The $m_(region)$ terms are the only unknowns in  and the equation can be expanded to isolate the terms with $m_(region)$, which is the parameter we are optimizing for in the MCMC method. The expanded form of Equation \ref{Hg_conc} is shown below:

\begin{align}
\begin{split}\label{Cs36PoGd2l}
Hg_{conc}={}& (m_{(MdD)}Hg_{sig_{(MdD)}} -m_oHg_{sig_{(MdD)}})+ (m_{(S-Puno)}Hg_{sig_{(S-Puno)}} -m_oHg_{sig_{(S-Puno)}}) \\
            &+ (m_{(N-Puno)}Hg_{sig_{(N-Puno)}} -m_0Hg_{sig_{(N-Puno)}}) + (m_{(Apr)}Hg_{sig_{(Apr)}} -m_oHg_{sig_{(Apr)}}) \\
            &+ (m_{(Aqp)}Hg_{sig_{(Aqp)}} -m_oHg_{sig_{(Aqp)}})+Hg_{m_0}
\end{split}
\end{align}

Since the values of $m_{(region)}$ are the parameters that we want to estimate using MCMC, they can represented as $\theta_i=m_{(region)}, i=1$ and the other terms including the background concentration are combined into one constant, C:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    Hg_{conc}  & = \theta_0C  + \theta_1Hg_{sig_{(MdD)}}+ \theta_2Hg_{sig_{(S-Puno)}} +  \theta_3Hg_{sig_{(N-Puno)}} \\
                & \ \ \ \  +\theta_4Hg_{sig_{(Apr)}} +  \theta_5Hg_{sig_{(Aqp)}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\begin{align}
Hg_{conc} =\begin{bmatrix} C & Hg_{sig_{(MdD)}} & Hg_{sig_{(S-Puno)}} &Hg_{sig_{(N-Puno)}} &Hg_{sig_{(Apr)}} &Hg_{sig_{(Aqp)}}\end{bmatrix} \times 
            \begin{bmatrix} \theta_0 \\ \theta_1 \\ \theta_2\\ \theta_3\\ \theta_4\\ \theta_5  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
where $\theta_0=1$ and $Hg_{conc}$ is the modeled Hg concentration at the observation site of interest.
