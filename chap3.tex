\chapter{Optimisation of GEOS-Chem Predictions of Mercury Concentrations in the Atmosphere}
\section{Background}
\begin{flushleft}


ASGM Hg emissions can be estimated by leveraging simulations of Hg in the atmosphere generated by the GEOS-Chem model. Atmospheric observations of Hg provide data to evaluate the models errors so that it is useful for the intended application. By combining top-down methods with existing bottom-up data, we improve estimates of Hg emissions from ASGM activities, using Peru and the Madre de Dios region of South America as case studies.

Anthropogenic Hg sources, including ASGM, have been quantified in numerous prior studies using different methodologies. Bottom-up estimates leverage collected data on underlying activities and multiply activity levels by emission factors to estimate regional and global totals. For instance, Figure \ref{fig:World_Hg_em} shows the most recent estimated spatial distribution of anthropogenic Hg emissions as reported in the 2018 Global Mercury Assessment, which also estimated ASGM Hg emissions to be 838 tonnes with an uncertainty range of 675-1000 tonnes for 2015\cite{united_nations_environment_programme_technical_2019}. Moreover, Streets et al. (2019) tested six different proxies for scaling emissions to other years and used an average value to scale the inventory of emissions to the year 2015 thus estimating that ASGM was the largest source and responsible for 775 Mg of emissions\cite{streets_global_2019}. Furthermore, Muntean et al. (2014) found that poverty in  gold ore rich countries (as measured by the GINI index \cite{sadefo_kamdem_nice_2012}, where available) was correlated with data on ASGM production activity when they used a poverty-based approach to estimate that ASGM was responsible for 728.27 t of emissions in 2010 which was equivalent to 41.1\% of the global emissions\cite{muntean_evaluating_2018}. Such inventories are comprehensible, and their universal applicability enables worldwide coverage. However, the different assumptions on the activity data and emission factors induce significant uncertainty in the emission inventories. An additional bias in the bottom-up approach originates from the reliance on officially reported emissions data, which might cause differences in accuracy between countries and regions.

National inventories are also a form of a bottom up inventory where countries identify and quantify the sources of mercury releases within their borders. Countries are required to include in their NAPs baseline estimates of the quantities of mercury used in ASGM and the produced estimate should have an accuracy of +/- 30\% and at worst +/- 50\% \cite{united_nations_environment_programme_estimating_2017}.

\begin{flushleft}
On the contrary, top-down emission estimation approaches combine atmospheric transport and chemistry models with atmospheric concentration measurements to quantify emissions. Even though the atmospheric chemistry literature has various top-down method applications, no study explicitly constrains ASGM Hg emissions. For instance, Bousquet et al., 1999 applied top-down methods to infer surface fluxes of atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} from observed concentrations\cite{bousquet_inverse_1999}. Furthermore, Kopacz et al., 2009, employed these techniques to quantify source contributions to ozone pollution at two adjacent sites on the U.S. west coast in the spring of 2006. Moreover, Stohl et al., 2010 determined the emissions of hydrochlorofluorocarbon and hydrofluorocarbon from four East Asian countries and the Taiwan region for the year 2008 using similar techniques. Hg emissions have also been constrained using top-down methods in Song et al., 2015 where they apply a top-down approach at a global scale to quantitatively estimate present-day Hg emission sources and critical parameters in GEOS-Chem to constrain the global biogeochemical cycle of Hg better. Moreover, Denzler et al., 2017 used a top-down approach to quantify Hg emissions on a European scale based on the atmospheric Hg measurements conducted at the remote high altitude monitoring station, Jungfraujoch, Switzerland. 
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
Herein we investigate the extent to which the GEOS-Chem model predicts the Hg concentrations in the atmosphere in regions with high ASGM activities such as the tropical regions of the world.  To our knowledge, there is a dearth of scientific studies investigating the extent to which models such as GEOS-Chem reproduce observed Hg concentrations in the atmosphere. The highly cited fact that that perpetuates the absence of such studies is the lack of monitoring data that researcher could use in modelling studies. However, the GMOS network has about 5 monitoring stations in Latin America whose data can be compared to modelling results. Moreover, the Wania Group in University of Toronto deployed numerous passive air samplers (PAS)  in different locations across Latin America to monitor Hg concentration in the atmosphere thus providing data that can be compared to model outputs. Therefore, we compare the modelled Hg concentrations in the atmosphere to observed concentrations assess the GEOS-Chem models strengths and short comings in reproducing the observed Hg concentrations in the atmosphere.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Modification of Mercury Inventories}
\begin{flushleft}
The \gc Hg model takes as input various types of data for the models parameterization of factors that influence concentration and transport of Hg in the atmosphere. Gridded emission inventories are the basis on which the emissions are parameterized in the model. Emissions inventories such as those shown on Figure \ref{fig:Hg_inventories} can be used as an input in \gc. Moreover, the relationship between the Hg concentration output and the input emissions is governed by a linear relationship.

The GMA 2018 ASGM emissions estimates for the year 2015 were used in the all the GEOS-Chem simulations we carried out. The  from individual grid boxes in the case study region as seen in Figure \ref{fig:GMA2018} were scaled and then used as input to the GEOS-Chem model. The emissions were scaled to investigate the relationship between the Hg concentration in the atmosphere and the changes in ASGM emissions from the case study region in Peru. Moreover, the Hg concentration signal resulting from scaling the emissions from a particular grid box was calculated using Equation \ref{doublingSig} below:
\end{flushleft}

\begin{flushleft}
\begin{equation}
\label{doublingSig}
Hg_{sig(region)}=\small\frac{(Hg_{m_1} -Hg_{m_0})}{(m_1 -m_0)}
\end{equation}
where:
\end{flushleft}

\begin{description}[leftmargin=!,labelwidth={3 em}]
    \item [$region$] is the specific department within the case study region.
    \item [$Hg_{m_1}$] is the Hg concentration signal at the observation site caused by scaling the emissions from a single grid box. 
    \item [$Hg_{m_0}$] is the baseline Hg concentration signal at the observation site when ASGM emissions are turned on in the GEOS-Chem simulation.
    \item [$m_1$] is the quantity of emissions in metric tonnes after scaling the emissions from a specific grid box.
\end{description}


\begin{flushleft}
$Hg_{sig(region)}$ gives the Hg concentration signal in the atmosphere that results from a unit change in the the tonnes of emissions from a specific grid box. Therefore, $Hg_{sig(region)}$ was used to investigate the sensitivity of the observations to the different amounts of additional ASGM Hg emissions and the regional grid boxes. The Hg concentration in the atmosphere that results from a specific change in emissions from a particular grid box was calculated using Equation \ref{ysignal} below.
\begin{equation}
\label{ysignal}
\small{Hg_{m(region)}} =Hg_{sig(region)}(m-m_o), 
\end{equation}

\subsection{Markov Chain Monte Carlo}

\begin{flushleft}
The Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a sampling method that is also useful for fitting models to data\cite{hogg_data_2018}. We apply the MCMC to constrain ASGM Hg emissions from the case study region in Peru.The basic idea behind this approach is to compare the generated models to the data. The model is generated by a set of parameters, emissions, and we aim to sample from the set of parameters that best fits our data. The MCMC is used to compare the modelled concentrations to the observed data using metrics such as the $95^{th}$ confidence interval, mean and the interquartile range. The MCMC generatively models given data by sampling around optimum values from the posterior distribution. The MCMC is a Bayesian approach; hence it requires the definition of priors on the parameters of interest. The priors encode information that we already know of the system. The probability of the model given the observed data is given by the posterior probability, $P(\theta|D)$, which is calculated using the Bayes theorem:

\begin{equation}
\label{bayes_eq}
P(\theta|D)=\frac{P(D|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(D)}
\end{equation}
where:
\end{flushleft}

\begin{description}[leftmargin=!,labelwidth={3 em}]
    \item [$P(D|\theta)$] is the likelihood which is the probability of the data given the model
    \item [$P(\theta)$] is the prior which is the probability of the model and 
    \item [$P(D)$] is the evidence which is the probability of the data.
\end{description}

\begin{flushleft}
The MCMC enables the estimation of the sampling of the posterior distribution which is the left-hand side of Equation~\ref{bayes_eq}. The MCMC is set set up by following a set of steps that include defining a function that outputs a model given a set of input parameters and establishing an ensemble of walkers defined by a $\theta$ vector that contains a set of parameters form the model generating function.For the model generating function the Hg concentration at a particular grid box is defined as a linear combination of Hg concentration signals from the case study region and the baseline Hg concentration as shown in the Equation \ref{Hg_conc} below:

\begin{align}
\begin{split}\label{Hg_conc}
Hg_{conc}= {}&Hg_{m(MdD)}+ Hg_{m(S-Puno)} + Hg_{m(N-Puno)} + Hg_{m(Apr)}+ Hg_{m(Aqp)}\\
            & +Hg_{m_0}
\end{split}
\end{align}

where:
\end{flushleft}

\begin{description}[leftmargin=!,labelwidth={5 em}]
    \item [$Hg_{m(MdD)}$] is the Hg concentration signal resulting from emissions from the Madre de Dios (MdD) grid box
    \item [$Hg_{m(S-Puno)}$] is the Hg concentration signal resulting from emissions from the South Puno (S-Puno) grid box
    \item [$Hg_{m(N-Puno)}$] is the Hg concentration signal resulting from emissions from the North Puno (N-Puno) grid box
    \item [$Hg_{m(Apr)}$] is the Hg concentration signal resulting from emissions from the Apurimac (Apr) grid box
    \item [$Hg_{m(Aqp)}$] is the Hg concentration signal resulting from emissions from the Arequipa (Aqp) grid box
    \item [$Hg_{m_0}$] is the baseline Hg concentration signal.
\end{description}

\begin{flushleft}
Each of the $Hg_{m(region)}$ terms of Equation \ref{Hg_conc} represent signals from the different departments are calculated using Equation~\ref{ysignal}. Equation~\ref{ysignal} The $m_(region)$ terms are the only unknowns in  and the equation can be expanded to isolate the terms with $m_(region)$, which is the parameter we are optimizing for in the MCMC method. The expanded form of Equation \ref{Hg_conc} is shown below:

\begin{align}
\begin{split}\label{Cs36PoGd2l}
Hg_{conc}={}& (m_{(MdD)}Hg_{sig_{(MdD)}} -m_oHg_{sig_{(MdD)}})+ (m_{(S-Puno)}Hg_{sig_{(S-Puno)}} -m_oHg_{sig_{(S-Puno)}}) \\
            &+ (m_{(N-Puno)}Hg_{sig_{(N-Puno)}} -m_0Hg_{sig_{(N-Puno)}}) + (m_{(Apr)}Hg_{sig_{(Apr)}} -m_oHg_{sig_{(Apr)}}) \\
            &+ (m_{(Aqp)}Hg_{sig_{(Aqp)}} -m_oHg_{sig_{(Aqp)}})+Hg_{m_0}
\end{split}
\end{align}

Since the values of $m_{(region)}$ are the parameters that we want to estimate using MCMC, they can represented as $\theta_i=m_{(region)}, i=1$ and the other terms including the background concentration are combined into one constant, C:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    Hg_{conc}  & = \theta_0C  + \theta_1Hg_{sig_{(MdD)}}+ \theta_2Hg_{sig_{(S-Puno)}} +  \theta_3Hg_{sig_{(N-Puno)}} \\
                & \ \ \ \  +\theta_4Hg_{sig_{(Apr)}} +  \theta_5Hg_{sig_{(Aqp)}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\begin{align}
Hg_{conc} =\begin{bmatrix} C & Hg_{sig_{(MdD)}} & Hg_{sig_{(S-Puno)}} &Hg_{sig_{(N-Puno)}} &Hg_{sig_{(Apr)}} &Hg_{sig_{(Aqp)}}\end{bmatrix} \times 
            \begin{bmatrix} \theta_0 \\ \theta_1 \\ \theta_2\\ \theta_3\\ \theta_4\\ \theta_5  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
where $\theta_0=1$ and $Hg_{conc}$ is the modeled Hg concentration at the observation site of interest.
