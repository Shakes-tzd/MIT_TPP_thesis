    "Anthropogenic Hg sources, including ASGM, have been quantified in numerous prior studies using different methodologies. Bottom-up estimates leverage collected data on underlying activities and multiply activity levels by emission factors to estimate regional and global totals. For instance, the 2018 Global Mercury Assessment estimated ASGM Hg emissions to be 838 tonnes with an uncertainty range of 675-1000 tonnes for 2015 \\cite{united_nations_environment_programme_technical_2019}. Moreover, Streets et al. (2019) tested six different proxies for scaling emissions to other years and used an average value to scale the inventory of emissions to the year 2015 thus estimating that ASGM was the largest source and responsible for 775 Mg of Hg emissions. Furthermore, Muntean et al. (2014) used a poverty-based approach to estimate that ASGM was responsible for 728.27 t of Hg emissions in 2010 which was equivalent to 41.1\\% of the global emissions. Such inventories are comprehensible, and their universal applicability enables worldwide coverage. However, the different assumptions on the activity data and emission factors induce significant uncertainty in the emission inventories. An additional bias in the bottom-up approach originates from the reliance on officially reported emissions data, which might cause differences in accuracy between countries and regions. Additionally national inventories are a form of a bottom up inventory where countries identify and quantify the sources of mercury releases within their borders. Countries are required to include in their NAPs baseline estimates of the quantities of mercury used in ASGM and the produced estimate should have an accuracy of +/- 30\\% and at worst +/- 50\\% \\cite{}\n",

    "On the contrary, top-down emission estimation approaches combine atmospheric transport and chemistry models with atmospheric concentration measurements to quantify emissions. For instance, Bousquet et al., 1999 applied top-down methods to infer surface fluxes of atmospheric CO\\textsubscript{2} from observed concentrations. Furthermore, Kopacz et al., 2009, quantified source contributions to ozone pollution at two adjacent sites on the U.S. west coast in the spring of 2006 using top-down techniques. Moreover, Stohl et al., 2010 determined the emissions of hydrochlorofluorocarbon and hydrofluorocarbon from four East Asian countries and the Taiwan region for the year 2008 using similar techniques. Hg emissions have also been constrained using top-down methods in Song et al., 2015 where they apply a top-down approach at a global scale to quantitatively estimate present-day Hg emission sources and critical parameters in GEOS-Chem to constrain the global biogeochemical cycle of Hg better. Moreover, Densler et al., 2017 used a top-down approach to quantify Hg emissions on a European scale based on the atmospheric Hg measurements conducted at the remote high altitude monitoring station, Jungfraujoch, Switzerland. Even though the atmospheric chemistry literature has various top-down method applications, no study explicitly constrains ASGM Hg emissions.\n",

    "The GEOS-Chem model (Bey et al., 2001) is used to simulate atmospheric concentrations of Hg for comparison with data from Hg monitoring stations. GEOS-Chem is a global-scale, 3-D atmospheric chemical transport model driven by meteorological input from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) of the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office. It runs at a resolution of 0.25° latitude x 0.3125° longitude horizontally, equivalent to $\\approx$27 km at the equator, and 72 levels in the vertical. GEOS-CHem has been used to simulate numerous atmospheric chemical species of interest, including Hg (Selin et al., 2008, Zhang et al., 2016, Selin et al., 2007, Holmes et al., 2010, Amos et al., 2012). Moreover, GEOS-Chem has also been used in international model comparisons to support the Global Mercury Assessment and the Minamata Convention on Mercury (Travnikov et al., 2017).\n",

    "The Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a sampling method that is also useful for fitting models to data. This paper applies the MCMC to constrain ASGM Hg emissions from five regions in Peru by comparing the model of the Hg concentration in the atmosphere against observed Hg concentrations using metrics such as the $95^{th}$ confidence interval and the interquartile range. MCMC generatively models given data by sampling around optimum values from the posterior distribution. The model is generated by a set of parameters that include the emissions from different grid boxes in Peru. The MCMC is a Bayesian approach; hence it requires the definition of priors on the parameters of interest. The priors encode information that we already know of the system. The probability of the model given the observed data is given by the posterior probability, $P(\\theta|D)$, which is calculated using the Bayes theorem:\n",
